- STATE 4 -> STATE 5: IF levelSensor >= 50cm (Liquid level reaches 50cm).

- STATE 5 -> STATE 6: IF levelSensor >= 80cm (Liquid level reaches 80cm), close valve B.

- STATE 7 -> STATE 8: IF mixMotorComplete = TRUE (Mixing is completed).

- STATE 8 -> STATE 1: After opening valve D, check the emergency stop condition to reset cycle or move back to initial state upon completion.

3. DECLARE THE NEEDED VARIABLES

- state: Int // Current state of the system
- prevState: Int // Previous state for transition validation
- estop: Bool // Emergency Stop Signal
- opeMode: Bool // Operation Mode
- valveAStart, valveBStart, valveCStart, valveDStart, mixMotorStart: Bool // Manual control buttons

{'title': 'Material Proportioning Process Control', 'description': 'Design a PLC program to control a material proportioning process that requires mixing three types of materials according to specific requirements and then delivering them to the next process through valve D. The system needs to support both manual and automatic operation modes and be able to safely stop all equipment when an emergency stop signal is triggered.\nControl requirements:\nEmergency Stop Logic: The #estop(=FALSE) signal is used for emergency stopping of all equipment.\nManual Mode: #opeMode=false, manually control the start/stop of valves A, B, C, D, and the mixing motor.\nAutomatic Mode: #opeMode=true, equipment operates automatically according to the process flow.\nImplement the emergency stop logic to ensure that all equipment stops immediately when the emergency stop signal is triggered.\nIn manual mode, manually control the start/stop of valves and the mixing motor.\nFor example, pressing the valve A start button valveAStart (triggering a rising edge) causes valve A to run (valveARun=TRUE); pressing the valve A start button valveAStart again (triggering a rising edge) stops valve A (valveARun=FALSE).\nIn automatic mode, implement the following control logic based on the process flow:\nPress the autoStart button to start the automatic process, first opening valve A.\nWhen the liquid level sensor #levelSensor reaches 50cm, close valve A and open valve B.\nWhen the liquid level sensor reaches 80cm, close valve B.\nBased on #processMode:\nIf #processMode=false, start the mixing motor; after receiving the mixing complete signal, stop the mixing motor, open valve D, and the automatic process ends.\nIf #processMode=true, open valve C; when the liquid level sensor reaches 100cm, close valve C, start the mixing motor; after receiving the mixing complete signal, stop the mixing motor, open valve D, and the automatic process ends.', 'type': 'FUNCTION_BLOCK', 'name': 'MaterialMixing', 'input': [{'name': 'estop', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Emergency Stop Signal\nFALSE: Emergency stop triggered\nTRUE: No emergency stop triggered'}, {'name': 'opeMode', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Operation Mode\nFALSE: Manual Operation Mode\nTRUE: Automatic Operation Mode'}, {'name': 'valveAStart', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve A Start Button'}, {'name': 'valveBStart', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve B Start Button'}, {'name': 'valveCStart', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve C Start Button'}, {'name': 'valveDStart', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve D Start Button'}, {'name': 'mixMotorStart', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Mixing Motor Start Button'}, {'name': 'autoStart', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Automatic Start Button'}, {'name': 'processMode', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Process Mode'}, {'name': 'levelSensor', 'type': 'Int', 'description': 'Liquid Level Sensor (unit cm)'}, {'name': 'mixMotorComplete', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Mixing Complete Signal'}], 'output': [{'name': 'valveARun', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve A Run Command'}, {'name': 'valveBRun', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve B Run Command'}, {'name': 'valveCRun', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve C Run Command'}, {'name': 'valveDRun', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve D Run Command'}, {'name': 'mixMotorRun', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Mixing Motor Run Command'}]}

TASK: PROPOSE THE PLAN FOR THE CODE, DETAILING WHAT EACH PART DOES AS WELL AS THE INTENDED OPERATION.

Assistant:
START_PLAN

0. DECLARE THE NEEDED STATES

- STATE 0: SYSTEM CHECK
- STATE 1: MANUAL MODE - CONTROL VALVES AND MIXING MOTOR
- STATE 2: AUTOMATIC MODE - START SEQUENCE
- STATE 3: AUTOMATIC MODE - FILL TO 50CM (OPEN VALVE A)
- STATE 4: AUTOMATIC MODE - FILL TO 80CM (CLOSE VALVE A, OPEN VALVE B)
- STATE 5: AUTOMATIC MODE - WAIT FOR MIXING COMPLETE
- STATE 6: AUTOMATIC MODE - OPEN VALVE D (END PROCESS)
- STATE 7: AUTOMATIC MODE - FILL TO 100CM (DEPENDING ON PROCESS MODE, OPEN VALVE C)
- STATE 8: EMERGENCY STOP

1. LIST THE OUTPUT VALUES FOR EACH STATE

- STATE 0: All outputs are set to safe shutdown (valveARun=FALSE, valveBRun=FALSE, valveCRun=FALSE, valveDRun=FALSE, mixMotorRun=FALSE)
- STATE 1: Outputs depend on manual inputs: (valveARun, valveBRun, valveCRun, valveDRun, mixMotorRun based on individual start buttons)
- STATE 2: All outputs are initially OFF; waiting for `autoStart` command to proceed
- STATE 3: valveARun=TRUE, other outputs FALSE
- STATE 4: valveARun=FALSE, valveBRun=TRUE, other outputs FALSE
- STATE 5: mixMotorRun as required by different processes until mixing complete signal
- STATE 6: valveDRun=TRUE, other outputs FALSE
- STATE 7: valveCRun=TRUE if #processMode = TRUE, other outputs FALSE
- STATE 8: All outputs set to FALSE immediately (Emergency Stop)

2. LIST THE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN STATES

- STATE 0 -> STATE 8: IF estop = FALSE (Emergency Stop Triggered)
- STATE 0 -> STATE 1: IF opeMode = FALSE AND estop = TRUE
- STATE 0 -> STATE 2: IF opeMode = TRUE AND estop = TRUE
- STATE 2 -> STATE 3: IF autoStart = TRUE
- STATE 3 -> STATE 4: IF levelSensor >= 50
- STATE 4 -> STATE 5: IF levelSensor >= 80 AND processMode = FALSE
- STATE 4 -> STATE 7: IF levelSensor >= 80 AND processMode = TRUE
- STATE 5 -> STATE 6: IF mixMotorComplete = TRUE
- STATE 7 -> STATE 5: IF levelSensor >= 100
- STATE 8 -> STATE 0: IF estop = TRUE (resumes normal conditions)

3. DECLARE THE NEEDED VARIABLES

- state: Int; // The current state of the system
- prevState: Int; // The previous state of the system
- estop: Bool; // Emergency stop signal input
- opeMode: Bool; // Operating mode input (Manual or Automatic)
- valveAStart, valveBStart, valveCStart, valveDStart: Bool; // Start inputs for valves in Manual Mode
- mixMotorStart: Bool; // Start input for mixing motor in manual mode
- autoStart: Bool; // Start input for automatic mode
- processMode: Bool; // Determines operation path in automatic mode
- levelSensor: Int; // Liquid level sensor input (unit cm)
- mixMotorComplete: Bool; // Mixing complete signal input
- valveARun, valveBRun, valveCRun, valveDRun, mixMotorRun: Bool; // Outputs for respective valves and motor
