    "description": "In some data processing and communication applications, it is necessary to decompose a 16-bit binary number into four independent 4-bit binary numbers. For example, such decomposition operations may be required during data encoding, decoding, or data exchange with external systems.\nControl requirements:\nThe system needs to receive a 16-bit binary number InputWord as input.\nDecompose the input 16-bit binary number into four 4-bit binary numbers, corresponding to the lowest to the highest bits of the input number.\nOutput these four 4-bit binary numbers to independent variables Byte0~Byte3.\nAt the same time, calculate the average of the non-zero variables among these four variables Byte0~Byte3 and output it to average.\nFor example, if InputWord=16#1203, then Byte0=3, Byte1=0, Byte2=2, Byte3=1, and the average value average=(1+2+3)/3",
