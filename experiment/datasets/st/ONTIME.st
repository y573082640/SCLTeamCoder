(* revision history
hm 22.2.2007		rev 1.1
	changed VAR RETAIN PERSISTENT to VAR RETAIN for better compatibility
	wago lon contollers do not support persisitent

hm 2.8.2007		rev 1.2
	adding time up in a real number will automatically lead to the point where 
	small time scales like the cycle time will be below the resolution of real and therefore
	ontime would not increase in small steps as necessary
	the time is now measured internally in two  dwords and be converted to real only for
	output purposes.
	deleted the variable power because it was unnecessary

hm	16.9.2007		rev 1.3
	changes time() to T_plc_ms() for compatibility reasons

hm	2. dec. 2007	rev 1.4
	chaged code for better performance

hm	16. mar. 2008	rev 1.5
	added type conversions to avoid warnings under codesys 3.0

hm	21. oct. 2008	rev 2.0
	changed module for much better performance and allow for external result storage

hm	10. nov. 2008	rev 2.1
	increased internal resolution to milliseconds

hm	16. nov. 2008	rev 2.2
	changed typecast to avoid warnings

hm	17. dec. 2008	rev 2.3
	fixed an error when in would be true for more then 49 days

hm	17. jan 2011	rev 2.4
	init will not clear seconds and cycles, only rst clears these values	

hm	18. mar. 2011	rev 2.5
	reset was not working
