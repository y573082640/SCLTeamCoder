(* revision history:

hm 4.10.2006		rev 1.1
	added the busy output which signals that the ramp is running.

hm 22.1.2007		rev 1.2
	deleted unused variable step

hm	17.9.2007		rev 1.3
	replaced time() with t_plc_ms() for compatibility reasons

hm	28. sep 2007	rev 1.4
	added outputs on and off
	busy is now disabled while en is false
	new coding for higher accuracy and performance

hm	5. oct 2007	rev 1.5
	added statements to allow for PT to be t#0s output jumps to max or min immediately

hm	2. dec 2007	rev 1.6
	corrected an error in calculation of step response

hm	25. dec 2007	rev 1.7
	corrected an error while step response was too slow for fast rise times

hm	16. oct. 2008	rev 1.8
	improved performance

hm	18. oct. 2008	rev 1.9
	renamed inout EN to E for compatibility reasons

hm	23. oct. 2008	rev 2.0
	new code using _RMP_W
