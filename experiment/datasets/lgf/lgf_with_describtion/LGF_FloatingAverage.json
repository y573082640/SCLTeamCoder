The values can be read in cyclically or triggered.\n\n## Functional description ##\n\nNote The block LGF_FloatingAverage does not query the data type for the input parameter value. \nFor data types other than REAL, either an implicit conversion is performed automatically or \nan error is generated during compilation.\nYou can find further information in the Chapter “Overview of Data Type Conversion” in the \nOnline Help section of the TIA Portal or under:\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109773506/100611494667\nThe block calculates the (moving) mean value based on the set window width. The window \nwidth indicates the maximum number of values read in last. After the maximum number of \nvalues has been read, the output windowSizeReached is set and each newly read value replaces \nthe oldest value (FIFO principle).\nTwo options are available for reading the values. With the input cyclicExecution, the values are \nread and calculated cyclically. With the trigger input, the values are read in and calculated with \neach pulse.",
