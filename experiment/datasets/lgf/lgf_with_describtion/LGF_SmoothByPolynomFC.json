The error squares \nof the distances between polynomial and real value are minimized. The smoothed values can \nbe determined from the polynomial parameters obtained in this way.\nThe function reads an array that is smoothed. ùëÅ ‚àí 4 smoothed measured values can be \ncalculated from N measured values. The output array contains the value 0 in the index (0,1,N-\n1,N). However, replacement values can be calculated.\n\n## Functional description ##\n\nThe 3rd degree compensation polynomial is calculated as follows:\n\nùëÅ ‚àí 4 smoothed measured values can thus be calculated from the N measured values. The \noutput array contains the value 0 in the index (0.1, N-1, N).\nThese ‚Äúmissing‚Äù values are calculated with the following formalisms:",
