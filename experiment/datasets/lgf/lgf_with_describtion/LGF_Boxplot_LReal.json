A Boxplot shows \nyou in which area the data is located and how it is distributed over this area. A Boxplot consists \nof the following parameters:\n• Minimum (smallest occurring value of the sample)\n• Lower or first quartile (below this value are 25% of the sample values)\n• Median or second quartile (below this value are 50% of the sample values)\n• Upper or third quartile (below this value are 75% of the sample values)\n• Maximum (largest occurring value of the sample)\nFigure: Boxplot\n\n## Functional description ##\n\nThe block sorts the data series and then calculates the so-called “five-point summary”:\nTable: Five-point summary\nCharacteristic value of the five-point summary Output parameter of the block\nMinimum (smallest occurring value of the sample) min\nLower or first quartile (below this value are 25% of \nthe sample values)\nq25\nMedian or second quartile (below this value are \n50% of the sample values)\nmedian\nUpper or third quartile (below this value are 75% of \nthe sample values)\nq75\nMaximum (largest occurring value of the sample) max\nIf outlier detection is activated, the block first calculates the limits. From these limit values, the \nvalues are recognized as outliers:\n\nThe block then calculates new values for the parameters max and min, which lie within the outlier \nlimits. The outliers are counted and output as a percentage.\nTo make it easier to judge how the data is distributed, the block also calculates the skew. The \nskewness lies between the values -1 and 1 with the following meaning:\n• -1: extremely left skewed distribution\n• 0: symmetrical distribution\n• 1: extreme right-skew distribution\nThe elements of the passed array are sorted in ascending order by the block. The \nLGF_Shellsort_LReal block is used for sorting.\nThe parameters are calculated as follows:\nTable: Boxplot formulas Parameters Formula",
