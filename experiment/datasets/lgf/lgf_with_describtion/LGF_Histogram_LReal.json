A class describes a value \ninterval in which the individual frequencies are added together. After specifying the number of \nclasses, the class width and the respective class center are calculated. The number of classes \nis limited to 15.\nThe distribution is represented as a rectangle around the class mean with the class width and \nthe cumulated frequency as height.\nFigure: Distribution\n\n## Functional description ##\n\nThe block sorts the transferred data and calculates the general class width using the transferred \nclass count and data range. The block then counts the values that lie within a class. In order to \ndraw a histogram, the block also calculates the necessary X and Y coordinates.\nThe elements of the passed array values are sorted in ascending order by the block. The \nLGF_Shellsort_UDInt block is used for sorting.\nThe number of classes can be specified using the following rule of thumb:\n\nFormulas",
