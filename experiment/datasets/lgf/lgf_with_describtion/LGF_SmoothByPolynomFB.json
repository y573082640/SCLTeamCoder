The error squares \nof the distances between polynomial and real value are minimized. The smoothed values can \nbe determined from the polynomial parameters obtained in this way.\nThe function reads-in a value with each positive edge on the insert input. As soon as five \nvalues have been read in, the block calculates a smoothed value and outputs it.\n\n## Functional description ##\n\nThe 3rd degree compensation polynomial is calculated as follows:\n\nùëÅ ‚àí 4 smoothed measured values can thus be calculated from the N measured values. The \noutput array contains the value 0 in the index (0.1, N-1, N).\nThese ‚Äúmissing‚Äù values are calculated with the following formalisms:",
