## Short description ##

This function generates a sawtooth-shaped signal profile. For this it uses the time interval of the 
calling Cyclic Interrupt OB.

## Functional description ##

Note The status of called commands is output in subFunctionStatus. In this case, the output value 
in status indicates which command caused the error. In this case, refer to the TIA Portal 
Online Help section for information on the respective commands.
The block calculates the values for a sawtooth-shaped signal profile, which is output to the 
output parameter value.
The amplitude, the offset in the Y-direction, the period, and the phase shift can be set at the 
input parameters.
The input parameter reset resets the signal profile. At the value output parameter, the value 0 is 
output as long as reset is set to TRUE.
The block must be called in a cyclic interrupt OB. The time interval of the calling cyclic interrupt 
OB is determined in the FB with the command QRY_CINT. For this, the constant name of the 
calling cyclic interrupt OB must be interconnected at the input parameter callOB.
The number of calculated values of the signal profile per period duration is calculated as follows:
𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒𝑠 =
𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
/𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑘𝐶𝑦𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑢𝑝𝑡𝑂𝐵
Note To obtain a continuous signal profile of the curve, the time interval of the cyclic interrupt OB 
should not be selected too large depending on the period duration.The Figure below shows the signal profile of the calculated values.
