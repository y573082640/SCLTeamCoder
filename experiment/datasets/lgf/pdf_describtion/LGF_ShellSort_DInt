## Short description ##

This block sorts an array of type DInt with any number of elements (max. 1000) in ascending or 
descending order and returns the sorted version of the array in the same variable.

## Functional description ##

The block sorts according to the shell sort procedure. Note that the execution time of the block 
depends significantly on how many elements the array to be sorted has. The overview below 
shows several measured values of the block depending on the number of array elements.
Average steps needed for execution: 𝒪(𝑛 ⋅ log(𝑛)^2)
Table: Execution times of the block LGF_ShellSort…
Number of array elements S7-1212C DC/DC/DC S7-1516-3 PN/DP
100 approx. 11-16 ms approx. 1-2 ms
Number of array elements S7-1212C DC/DC/DC S7-1516-3 PN/DP
1000 approx. 185-205 ms approx. 10-12 ms
Note The block is executed synchronously and is not split over several PLC cycles. Thus the 
execution time has a direct effect on the PLC cycle time. Note this behavior for your project 
of the controller used and adjust the monitoring time of the controller if necessary.
