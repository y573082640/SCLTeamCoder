## Short description ##

This function implements a characteristic curve. The characteristic curve is defined via an 
interpolation point table with linear interpolation between the interpolation points. A prescribed 
input value generates an output value in each cycle based on the characteristic curve from the 
interpolation point table.

## Functional description ##

The value of the output outputValue based on the following priority:
1. As long as the input enDefaultOutValue is set, the value defined via the parameter 
defaultOutValue will be output as output value.
2. As long as the input reset is set, the block is reset and the output value is 0.0.
3. If the input track is set, the output value will be output directly as input value, without 
consideration of the characteristic curve.
4. Based on the input value, a characteristic curve value is calculated via the linearly 
interpolated, interpolation point table and output as an output value.
– If the input value is between two interpolation points within the interpolation point table, 
the output value is calculated as the intersection with the connecting line between the 
preceding and following interpolation points (see Figure below).
– If the input value is before the first interpolation point (lowest value defined in the 
interpolation point table), the output value will be calculated as the intersection of the 
line formed by the first two interpolation points of the interpolation point table.
– If the input value is after the last interpolation point (highest value defined in the 
interpolation point table), the output value will be calculated as the intersection of the 
line formed by the last two interpolation points of the interpolation point table.
Interpolation point table
The interpolation point table is implemented through a variable of the data type Array. The type 
of the array corresponds to the PLC data type LGF_typeNonLinSetpoints.
You can create the interpolation point table in any global data block. The size of the array 
depends on the number of interpolation points.
NOTICE To keep the computing time of the block as short as possible, there is no check of the 
parameterization or the data of the interpolation point table.
When entering the interpolation points in the interpolation point table, the following 
particularities must be considered. If these particularities are not taken into account, it can 
lead to a malfunction of the block.
• At least two interpolation points must be entered in the interpolation point table.
• The interpolation points in the interpolation point table must be entered in the Table in ascending 
order of the input values.
