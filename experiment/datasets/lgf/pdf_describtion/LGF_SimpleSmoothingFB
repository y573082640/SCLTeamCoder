## Short description ##

The function calculates the linear mean value cyclically.
The simplest form of smoothing a sequence of measured values is to calculate the linear mean 
value by three points.
The function reads-in a value with each positive edge on the insert input. As soon as three 
values have been read in, the block calculates a smoothed value and outputs it.

## Functional description ##

The function calculates the smoothed values using the following formula:
𝑦(𝑛) = (𝑦(𝑛 − 1) + 𝑦(𝑛) + 𝑦(𝑛 + 1)) / 3
The calculated value is output or the calculated values are output at output smoothedValue.
Based on this formula, the function cannot calculate values for the elements 0 and N.
