## Short description ##

This function calculates the smoothed values by polynomial acyclically.
For smoothing, a 3rd degree polynomial is placed through five value points. The error squares 
of the distances between polynomial and real value are minimized. The smoothed values can 
be determined from the polynomial parameters obtained in this way.
The function reads an array that is smoothed. 𝑁 − 4 smoothed measured values can be 
calculated from N measured values. The output array contains the value 0 in the index (0,1,N-
1,N). However, replacement values can be calculated.

## Functional description ##

The 3rd degree compensation polynomial is calculated as follows:

𝑁 − 4 smoothed measured values can thus be calculated from the N measured values. The 
output array contains the value 0 in the index (0.1, N-1, N).
These “missing” values are calculated with the following formalisms:
