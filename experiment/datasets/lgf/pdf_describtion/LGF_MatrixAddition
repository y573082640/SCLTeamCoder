## Short description ##

This block adds two matrices of equal size of the data type ARRAY[*,*] of LREAL.
The individual fields of the two incoming matrices are read, added and then output in the matrix 
matrixResult.
Note Note that all input and output matrices must have the same low and high limits and therefore 
the same number of columns and rows.
