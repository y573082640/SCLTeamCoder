## Short description ##

The function compares two structured actual parameters (array, PLC data type) and outputs 
whether they are of the same type and have the same values.
Compare arrays or plc datatypes and their values up to a max lengh of 200 Bytes of the 
connected variables. If at least one value of an element is not identical –> set function result = 
false
Restrictions:
The attached structure must not include Strings
The attached structure can not exceed 200 bytes, because of the internal buffer size

## Functional description ##

Note The status of called commands is output in subFunctionStatus. In this case, the output value 
in status indicates which command caused the error. In this case, refer to the TIA Portal 
Online Help section for information on the respective commands.
This block compares two (structured) actual parameters and shows whether they equate to the 
same value.
Note The following differences cannot be detected with the comparison method (byte level):
• Variables of the data type Struct cannot be compared.
• For strings, there may be differences in the range between the actual length and the maximum 
length.
• With REAL numbers in the structure, a disparity can also be displayed for “same” variables.
• Variables of the type ARRAY of BOOL cannot be checked for equality with the function, because 
the command used, CountOfElements, also counts the filling elements (e.g. 8 is returned with an 
ARRAY[0..1] of BOOL).
