## Short description ##

The Function represents a shift register for any kind of Datatype (using variant).
It is possible to shift the elements in the array at bufferRegister to the left (index 
array[n]:=array[n+1]) or right (index array[n]:=array[n-1]).
It could be used for material tracking trough a machine or a process, e.g. for a rotary indexing 
table.
Note As this is a real shift operation, it may cause some runtime effects while using big array sizes 
to move at the input bufferRegister.
Please consider that a FIFO or LIFO storage, based on indexes, could be used as well for 
most applications.
