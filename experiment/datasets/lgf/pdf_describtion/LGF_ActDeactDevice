## Short description ##

LGF_ActDeactDevice implements a compact state machine to activate and monitor or deactivate 
decentral devices.
The module monitors as well the device connection and error state after activation.
It works for PN (S7-1200 / S7-1500) and DP (S7-1500) devices.

## Functional description ##

The module provides the procedure for activating and deactivating remote IO-Devices in the 
Profinet (PN, S7-1500 & S7-1200) and Profibus (DP, S7-1500) network.
The activation of the device (defined at hwId) is initiated by a rising edge at activate, after 
complete activation this is indicated at the output isActivated and deviceStateOK. After that the 
connection status is displayed at the deviceStateOK output.
The connection is monitored and in case of a failure of this of more than the set monitoring time 
timeOutStateMonitoring at the output and reported as an error. After successful recovery of the 
connection by the system, the configured time is also waited until the error is reset to ensure 
stability.
Note The connection status of the decentralized device can also be displayed in the TIA Portal 
project navigation in the PLC, which is the controller, under the item ‘Distributed I/O’, if they 
are online with the engineering system.
Deactivation of the device (defined at hwId) is initiated by a rising edge at deactivate, after 
complete activation this is indicated at the output isDeactivated.
It is possible to define the states for switching on and off, as well as the monitoring times for 
activating and deactivating and the connection monitoring.All errors are automatically reset as soon as the faulty state is eliminated.
The exception to this are errors that can only be corrected by an intervention in the software, 
such as an incorrect or non-existent hardware ID of a non-existent decentralized IO device.
