## Short description ##

This function block offers writing data as binary / serialized data stream to a file which is then 
stored on the PLC's memory card in the folder UserFiles.

## Functional description ##

With the function LGF_FileWrite the data budget of a variable can be written to data in a file. For 
writing the data it is necessary to serialize it, which the function already takes from the user.
For serialization an external buffer in the form of a byte array must be connected which can take 
up the data quantity, if the buffer is too small an error is output.
The file name must always be specified in full together with the folder name and the file 
extension in the following format: UserFiles/test.dat.
Note The file extension (here e.g. dat) can be freely selected or omitted, it is useful for external 
processing to indicate the format of the file to the user.
A file extension in the file name has no influence on the content of the file as well as its 
formatting, to provide the data in an appropriate file format is up to the user.
