## Short description ##

FIFO (First-In First-Out / Queue / ring buffer memory)
This function stores incoming data and outputs the oldest unprocessed data.

## Functional description ##

Note The status of called commands is output in subFunctionStatus. In this case, the output value 
in status indicates which command caused the error. In this case, refer to the TIA Portal 
Online Help section for information on the respective commands.
Note In computer science, the queue is also based on the FIFO principle.
With the enqueue input, a new item is stored from the InOut parameter item in the next free 
position in the buffer. The output elementCount is incremented by one.
With the dequeue input, the next element to be processed is output to the InOut parameter item, 
and this field in the buffer is replaced by the value in the parameter initialItem. The output 
elementCount decremented by one.
With the reset input, the buffer is initialized and the index and counter are reset. The 
elementCount output is set to zero and the isEmpty output is set to TRUE.
With the clear input, the buffer is emptied and initialized with the initial value initialItem. Index 
and counter are reset. The elementCount output is set to zero and the isEmpty output is set to 
TRUE.
