## Short description ##

This function generates a sawtooth-shaped signal profile. Each sawtooth consists of a defined 
number of steps (increments).

## Functional description ##

Note Please note that changes at the input parameters only become effective with reset.
The block calculates the values for a sawtooth-shaped signal profile, which is output to the 
output parameter value. The signal begins with the start value startValue and is added with the 
value increment after each elapse of the time interval timeRange. The value can also be 
negative.
If the variable endlessSteps is set to FALSE, the number of add operations is counted. If this 
exceeds the value numberSteps, the output parameter value is set back to the start value. A new 
sawtooth begins.
If the variable endlessSteps is set to TRUE, the value increment is added without interruption, 
starting once at startValue. If the maximum positive INT value range (32767) of the output 
parameter value is exceeded, value changes to the maximum negative INT value range (-32768) and will continue to be added up.
Note The duration of a sawtooth at endlessSteps on FALSE is calculated as follows:
Duration = #timeRange * (#numberSteps + 1)
