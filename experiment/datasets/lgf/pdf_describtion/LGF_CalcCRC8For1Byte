## Short description ##

The CRC calculation is used for error detection at data transmission. The result of a calculation 
returns a CRC value via the data sent (Byte). The receiver detects a faulty transmission due to 
the unequal CRC value. The function LGF_CalcCRC8For1Byte uses 8 bits as the generator 
polynomial (mask).

## Functional description ##

The function calculates the CRC value from a data byte value. The start value initValue and 
the generator polynomial mask can be freely selected.
Note Various online tools are available for calculating the CRC values. The function of the block 
was tested with the following online tool, since it supports the input parameters mask
(Polynomial) and initValue (Initial Value):
