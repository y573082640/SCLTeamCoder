## Short description ##

The function calculates the linear mean value acyclically.
The simplest form of smoothing a sequence of measured values is to calculate the linear mean 
value by three points.
The function reads an array that is smoothed. ùëÅ ‚àí 2 smoothed measured values can be 
calculated from N measured values. Therefore, the output array in the index (0) and index (N) 
contains the value 0.

## Functional description ##

The function calculates the smoothed values using the following formula:

The calculated value is output or the calculated values are output at output smoothedValue.
Based on this formula, the function cannot calculate values for the elements 0 and N.
