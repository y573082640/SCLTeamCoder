## Short description ##

If you want to get an overview of existing data, you can use a Boxplot diagram. A Boxplot shows 
you in which area the data is located and how it is distributed over this area. A Boxplot consists 
of the following parameters:
• Minimum (smallest occurring value of the sample)
• Lower or first quartile (below this value are 25% of the sample values)
• Median or second quartile (below this value are 50% of the sample values)
• Upper or third quartile (below this value are 75% of the sample values)
• Maximum (largest occurring value of the sample)

## Functional description ##

The block sorts the data series and then calculates the so-called “five-point summary”:
Table: Five-point summary
Characteristic value of the five-point summary Output parameter of the block
Minimum (smallest occurring value of the sample) min
Lower or first quartile (below this value are 25% of 
the sample values)
q25
Median or second quartile (below this value are 
50% of the sample values)
median
Upper or third quartile (below this value are 75% of 
the sample values)
q75
Maximum (largest occurring value of the sample) max
If outlier detection is activated, the block first calculates the limits. From these limit values, the 
values are recognized as outliers:

The block then calculates new values for the parameters max and min, which lie within the outlier 
limits. The outliers are counted and output as a percentage.
To make it easier to judge how the data is distributed, the block also calculates the skew. The 
skewness lies between the values -1 and 1 with the following meaning:
• -1: extremely left skewed distribution
• 0: symmetrical distribution
• 1: extreme right-skew distribution
The elements of the passed array are sorted in ascending order by the block. The 
LGF_Shellsort_UDInt block is used for sorting.
The parameters are calculated as follows:
