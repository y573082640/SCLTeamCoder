## Short description ##

This function generates a signal that changes between the values FALSE and TRUE depending on 
a defined frequency and a pulse pause ratio.

## Functional description ##

The clock output is a Boolean value that toggles at the desired frequency. The pulsePauseRatio
input is used to set the pulse pause ratio.
The output countdown outputs the remaining time of the current state of clock.
If the desired frequency or pulse pause ratio is less than or equal to 0.0, the output clock = 
FALSE and countdown = 0s.
