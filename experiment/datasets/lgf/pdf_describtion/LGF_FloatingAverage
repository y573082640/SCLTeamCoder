## Short description ##

This function calculates a moving arithmetic mean value from REAL values. This method can be 
used to smooth data series. The values can be read in cyclically or triggered.

## Functional description ##

Note The block LGF_FloatingAverage does not query the data type for the input parameter value. 
For data types other than REAL, either an implicit conversion is performed automatically or 
an error is generated during compilation.
You can find further information in the Chapter “Overview of Data Type Conversion” in the 
Online Help section of the TIA Portal or under:

The block calculates the (moving) mean value based on the set window width. The window 
width indicates the maximum number of values read in last. After the maximum number of 
values has been read, the output windowSizeReached is set and each newly read value replaces 
the oldest value (FIFO principle).
Two options are available for reading the values. With the input cyclicExecution, the values are 
read and calculated cyclically. With the trigger input, the values are read in and calculated with 
each pulse.
