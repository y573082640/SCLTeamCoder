## Short description ##

This function limits the rate of change of an input variable. A jump function becomes a ramp 
function.

## Functional description ##

Note The status of called commands is output in subFunctionStatus. In this case, the output value 
in status indicates which command caused the error. In this case, refer to the TIA Portal 
Online Help section for information on the respective commands.
The ramp is a limit line and refers to a rate of change per second; if, for example, setChangeRate 
= 10.0 is parameterized at a sampling time of 1s/100ms/10ms for every block call, then if value 
> delayedValue, 10.0/1.0/0.1 is added to delayedValue until value is reached.
The limitation of the rate of change applies to both positive and negative values for the rise and 
fall.
The output delayedValue can be preset or initialized.
The time interval of the calling cyclic interrupt OB is determined by interconnecting the calling 
cyclic interrupt OB at the input parameter callOB.
Pre-assigning an output
If enDefaultOutValue = TRUE is set, the value at defaultOutValue is output. When changing 
from TRUE to FALSE, the output delayedValue is ramped from defaultOutValue to value. When 
changing from FALSE to TRUE, the output delayedValue immediately jumps to defaultOutValue.
