## Short description ##

This function multiplies two matrices of the data type ARRAY[*,*] of LREAL.
The block multiplies two matrices of variable size. The individual elements of the two incoming 
matrices are read, multiplied, and then output in the matrixResult matrix.
Note Note that the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in 
the second matrix.
The size of the initial matrix (m * n) results from the number of rows (m) of matrix1 and the 
number of columns (n) of matrix2.
