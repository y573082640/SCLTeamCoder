## Short description ##

Checks if a given value is within a specified tolerance in percent of a given set point.
The block has a configurable timing for set point change hiding, lower limit and as well for upper 
limit violation hiding.

## Functional description ##

The setpoint, lowerMinimum and upperMaximum variables define a value range.
The function checks whether the value is below, in or above the value range. The outputs 
belowLowLimit, inLimits, or overHighLimit show where the value is located.
By the configuration it is possible to define whether the borders are given as absolute values or 
in percentage from set point.
The timing could be adjusted for set point changes and as well for hiding the violating of the 
lower or upper limit in case of peaks.
