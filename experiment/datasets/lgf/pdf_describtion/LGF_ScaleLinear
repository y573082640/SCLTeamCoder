## Short description ##

This function scales an input variable (LReal) via a linear straight-line equation.

## Functional description ##

The function linearly scales an input variable (e.g. an analog input value) to a specific output 
variable (e.g. level).
To determine the output variable, the following linear equation is used in the function:
𝑥 =
((𝑦2 − 𝑦1) / (𝑥2 − 𝑥1)) * (𝑥 − 𝑥1) + 𝑦1
The straight line is described by the two points, P1 and P2. You specify the points as a 
Cartesian coordinate system using x and y coordinates.
Note If the values of the parameters x1 and x2 are the same, the value of y1 is output on output y
By specifying yMin and yMax you can restrict the calculated value of y to a range limited at top 
and bottom. Thus, you avoid override and underride ranges.
