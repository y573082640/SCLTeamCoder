## Short description ##

The function approximately calculates the area under a function curve. The function curve is 
transferred as an analog value (LReal) which varies over time. The integral value is output on 
integral.
The implementation is based on the trapezoidal rule and uses [ms] as time base.

Note The status of called commands is output in subFunctionStatus. In this case, the output value 
in status indicates which command caused the error. In this case, refer to the TIA Portal 
Online Help section for information on the respective commands.
The integral calculation includes the summation of those trapezoidal areas that span between 
the last two function values on the “value” input and the time. The elapsed time is calculated via 
the system time of the CPU. This trapezoidal area is identical to the product of the mean value 
of the two process values and the time interval.
Note The calculation takes [ms] as time base. So the analoge value hase to use the same time 
base, e.g. [volume flow/ms].
𝐴 = 1/2 * (𝐹𝑡1 + 𝐹𝑡0) * (𝑡1 − 𝑡0) + 1/2 * (𝐹𝑡2 + 𝐹𝑡1) *(𝑡2− 𝑡1) + ...
Start the integral calculation for the inputvalue at the parameter value:
• Set the parameter enable to the value TRUE
• Set the parameter reset to the value FALSE
If the parameter enable is set to the value FALSE, the integral calculation is stopped and the 
output integral outputs the last calculated value.
If the parameter reset is set to the value TRUE, the output integral is reset to 0.0
