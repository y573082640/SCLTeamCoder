## Short description ##

LIFO (Last-In First-Out / Stack buffer memory)
This function stores incoming data and outputs the latest/most recent not-yet-processed data.

## Functional description ##

Note The status of called commands is output in subFunctionStatus. In this case, the output value 
in status indicates which command caused the error. In this case, refer to the TIA Portal 
Online Help section for information on the respective commands.
Note I computer science the stack is also based on the LIFO principle.
With the push input, a new item is stored from the InOut parameter item in the next free position 
in the buffer. The output elementCount is incremented by one.
With the pop input, the latest / most recent item is output to the InOut parameter item, and this 
field in the buffer is replaced by the value at the parameter initialItem. The output 
elementCount is decremented by one.
The peek input allows the last entry in the buffer to be read out. The buffer is not changed.
With the reset input, the buffer is initialized and the index and counter are reset. The 
elementCount output is set to zero and the isEmpty output is set to TRUE.
With the clear input, the buffer is emptied and initialized with the initial value initialItem. Index 
and counter are reset. The elementCount output is set to zero and the isEmpty output is set to 
TRUE.
