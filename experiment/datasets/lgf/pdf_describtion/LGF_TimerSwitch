## Short description ##

This block is a timer. It is possible to define daily, weekly, monthly, yearly time switch points and 
time switch points for working days or weekend days.
Mode: Permanently off: 0, Daily: 1, Weekly: 2, Monthly: 3, Yearly: 4, Workday: 5, Weekend: 6, 
Permanently on: 10
The time value is always compared with the local time of the PLC, therefore the time value 
specified at the On and Off parameters must be specified as local time.

## Functional description ##

Note The status of called commands is output in subFunctionStatus. In this case, the output value 
in status indicates which command caused the error. In this case, refer to the TIA Portal 
Online Help section for information on the respective commands.
Note The function uses internally the system function RD_LOC_T to read the local time of the CPU, 
for the correct function it is therefore necessary that the local time of the CPU is set correctly.
The block offers various timer types, which are determined in the mode parameter:
• Permanently off (mode = 0)
• Daily timer (mode = 1)
• Weekly timer (mode = 2)
• Monthly timer (mode = 3)
• Yearly timer (mode = 4)
• Weekdays, Monday to Friday (mode = 5)
• Weekend, Saturday and Sunday (mode = 6)
• Permanently on (mode = 10)
The time value is always compared with the local time of the PLC, therefore the time value 
specified at the On and Off parameters must be specified as local time.
Depending on the mode, the following formal parameters must be interconnected:
Mode. Mode Required - formal parameters
0 . Permanently OFF – none
1 . Daily timer – onHour / offHour
– onMinute / offMinute
2 . Weekly timer – onWeekday / offWeekday
– onHour / offHour
– onMinute / offMinute
3 . Monthly timer – onDay / offDay
– onHour / offHour
– onMinute / offMinute
4 . Yearly timer – onMonth / offMonth
– onDay / offDay
– onHour / offHour
– onMinute / offMinute
5 . Weekdays – onHour / offHour
– onMinute / offMinute
6 . Weekend – onHour / offHour
– onMinute / offMinute
10 . Permanently ON – none
If the set start time equals the current local time of the controller, the output signal is set to 
TRUE. If the set switch-off time equals the current local time of the controller, the signal output is 
reset again.
Note Please note that the block can be used in the “Monthly timer” modes (mode = 3) or “yearly 
timer” (mode = 4) the block only switches if the days that you specify at the input parameters, 
“onDay” and “offDay”, actually occur in this month.
