## Short description ##

This function generates a random value with each call.
The random number has the data type UDInt.

## Functional description ##

Note The status of called commands is output in subFunctionStatus. In this case, the output value 
in status indicates which command caused the error. In this case, refer to the TIA Portal 
Online Help section for information on the respective commands.
The function generates random values in the range:
0 ≤ 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑉𝑎𝑙 ≤ 4294967295.
The random value is formed from the nanoseconds of the current system time of the CPU. The 
byte order of this value is inverted and then converted to UDInt.
