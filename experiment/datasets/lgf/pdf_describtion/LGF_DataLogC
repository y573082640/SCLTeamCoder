## Short description ##

LGF_DataLogC (C -> Compact) function integrates all the datalog system functions and can be 
used as standalone data logger.

## Functional description ##

The function LGF_DataLogC combines the system functions for creating and writing data logs in 
one block.
The procedure provides that an existing Datalog is opened on the basis of the name (name), if it 
was not created before, this is recognized and the function creates the Datalog.
Afterwards, depending on the parameterization, the data is written from data in an adjustable 
interval or only on request to triggerLogEntry.
ReadMe The functionality of Datalogs can be found in the user manual:
• DataLogCreate
• DataLogOpen
• DataLogClose
• DataLogWrite
• DataLogClear
• DataLogDelete
NOTICE The following parameters are only effective when creating a data log:
• parameter.header
• parameter.maxNumberOfEntries
• parameter.timestampFormat (S7-1200 and the S7-1500 support different formats, see the 
manual DataLogCreate)
NOTICE When logging data by interval (isLoggingByInterval) time variances occur, which are 
caused by a fluctuating cycle time.
Therefore it is recommended to call the function in a time interrupt OB besides the call in the 
cyclic program and to set the trigger for writing in this interrupt OB.
NOTICE A data log which is deleted by the function without deleting the file cannot be created again 
as long as the file exists, it must first be deleted manually in the system.
Please also note the parameter parameter.deleteFile which also deletes the file next to the 
data in case of a delete command deleteLog.
