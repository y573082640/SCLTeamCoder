## Short description ##

The histogram shows the frequency distribution of a sample by class. A class describes a value 
interval in which the individual frequencies are added together. After specifying the number of 
classes, the class width and the respective class center are calculated. The number of classes 
is limited to 15.
The distribution is represented as a rectangle around the class mean with the class width and 
the cumulated frequency as height.

## Functional description ##

The block sorts the transferred data and calculates the general class width using the transferred 
class count and data range. The block then counts the values that lie within a class. In order to 
draw a histogram, the block also calculates the necessary X and Y coordinates.
The elements of the passed array values are sorted in ascending order by the block. The 
LGF_Shellsort_UDInt block is used for sorting.
The number of classes can be specified using the following rule of thumb:
