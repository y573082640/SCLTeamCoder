## Short description ##

This block counts in a variable of type DWord how many bits are set (TRUE) and how many are 
not set (FALSE) and outputs the number at the outputs.
Instead of DWord, Word and Byte can also be used by converting the past parameter with e.g. 
BYTE_TO_DWORD and connecting the corresponding bit length of the data type at the 
parameter “numberOfBits”.
Byte=8, Word=16, DWord=32
