## Short description ##

This function calculates the smoothed values by polynomial cyclically.
For smoothing, a 3rd degree polynomial is placed through five value points. The error squares 
of the distances between polynomial and real value are minimized. The smoothed values can 
be determined from the polynomial parameters obtained in this way.
The function reads-in a value with each positive edge on the insert input. As soon as five 
values have been read in, the block calculates a smoothed value and outputs it.

## Functional description ##

The 3rd degree compensation polynomial is calculated as follows:

𝑁 − 4 smoothed measured values can thus be calculated from the N measured values. The 
output array contains the value 0 in the index (0.1, N-1, N).
These “missing” values are calculated with the following formalisms:
