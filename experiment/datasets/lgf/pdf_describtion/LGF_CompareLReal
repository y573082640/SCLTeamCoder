## Short description ##

This function checks floating point numbers for equality, by using an approximation formula and 
a fixed precision by constant 1.0E-12 (pico)

## Functional description ##

The comparison of the LREAL numbers is based on an fixed accuracy of 1.0E-12. The 
difference between the two input values must be smaller than the PRECISION accuracy multiplied 
by one of the two input values.
Equation:
Note If your application requires a different accuracy when comparing the numbers, adapt the 
“PRECISION” constant in the function to your requirements.
Or you may use the FC LGF_CompareLRealByPrecision.
