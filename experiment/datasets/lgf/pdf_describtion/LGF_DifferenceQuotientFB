## Short description ##

This function numerically differentiates a signal sampled equidistantly in time. For example, the 
velocity can be calculated from a measured locus curve, or the acceleration can be calculated 
from the measured velocity. In order to minimize the effects of a scattering measurement signal, 
this algorithm uses a compensating polynomial.
The function block calculates the differentiated values cyclically.
The function block reads-in a value with each positive edge on the insert been read in, the 
block calculates a differentiated value and outputs it.

## Functional description ##

To calculate the difference quotient of a scattering signal, a third-degree compensation 
polynomial is first placed through the measured values. This polynomial is then differentiated. 
With this method, even a distorted input signal can be sensibly differentiated.
The difference quotient is calculated with the following formula:

The function (FC) can calculate ùëÅ ‚àí 4 differentiated and smoothed measured values from N 
measured values. The output array would be assigned with 0 in the index (0,1,N-1,N). However, 
the following formalisms can be used to calculate substitute values:
