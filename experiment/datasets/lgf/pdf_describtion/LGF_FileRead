## Short description ##

This function block offers reading data as binary / serialized data stream from files stored on the 
PLC's memory card in the folder UserFiles.

## Functional description ##

With the function LGF_FileRead a file can be read into the data budget of a variable at data. To 
read the data it is necessary to deserialize it, which the function already takes from the user.
For deserialization an external buffer in the form of a byte array must be connected which can 
take up the amount of data, if the buffer is too small an error is output.
The file name must always be specified in full together with the folder name and the file 
extension in the following format: UserFiles/test.dat.
