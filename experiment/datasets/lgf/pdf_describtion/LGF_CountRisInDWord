## Short description ##

The function analyzes a variable of the type DWORD and outputs how often a 0-1 sequence 
(rising edge) occurs in the variable.
Note LEGACY FUNCTION
Please update and use the FB with the same name LGF_CountRisInDWord in the future!
This function is no longer maintained!

## Functional description ##

In a variable of the data type DWORD, the block counts the rising edges (0-1 transitions) from 
left to right. The output countRisInDWord outputs the number of rising edges.
So that rising edges at the variable limit are also detected, the input value is copied to the static 
variable statDWordPrevCycle at the end of the evaluation and evaluated in the next cycle.
