## Short description ##

This function compares two matrices of the data type ARRAY[*,*] of LREAL of equal size.
If both matrices are identical, the return value of the function is set to TRUE.
Note Note that all input matrices must have the same lower and upper limit, and, therefore, the 
same number of columns and rows.
