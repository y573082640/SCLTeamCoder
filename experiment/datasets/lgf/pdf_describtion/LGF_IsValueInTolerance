The value range is defined with a set point, as well as a tolerance range, around the set point in 
percent (%). The function calculates the low limit and high limit of the value range.

The function checks whether the value is below, in or above the value range. The outputs 
belowLowLimit, Ret_Val, or overHighLimit show where the value is located.
