## Short description ##

This function checks floating point numbers for equality, by using an approximation formula and 
a fixed precision by constant 1.0E-12 (pico)

## Functional description ##

The comparison of the LREAL numbers is based on an given accuracy at the parameter 
precision. The difference between the two input values must be smaller than the precision
accuracy value multiplied by one of the two input values.
Equation:
