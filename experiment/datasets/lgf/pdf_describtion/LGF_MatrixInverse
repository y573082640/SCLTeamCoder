## Short description ##

This function inverts a square matrix of the data type ARRAY[*,*] of LREAL.
The square matrix of any size will be inverted according to the Shipley-Coleman method.
𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑥𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑢𝑙𝑡 = 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑥^(−1)
Note Note that the input matrix must be square. This means that the number of rows must be 
equal to the number of columns. The output matrix must be the same size and have the 
same array boundaries as the input matrix.
