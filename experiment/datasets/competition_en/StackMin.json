Push operation: When a new element is pushed, first check if the stack is full. If the stack is full, do nothing. Otherwise, add it to the top of the stack array and update the top position.\n2. Pop operation: When performing a pop operation, first check if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, do nothing. Otherwise, remove the minimum value from the stack and return the value of that element, while updating the top position.
