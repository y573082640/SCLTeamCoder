Type Function module
Input I1: BOOL (input 1)
I2: BOOL (input 2)
TL: TIME (lock time)
Output Q1: BOOL (output 1)
Q2: BOOL (output 2)
The module INTERLOCK has 2 inputs I1 and I2 which passes to each of the
outputs Q1 and Q2. Q1 and Q2, however, are interlocked so that only one
output is set to TRUE. The time TL sets a dead time between the two outï¿¾puts. An output can only be true if the other output was at least for the
time TL FALSE.
