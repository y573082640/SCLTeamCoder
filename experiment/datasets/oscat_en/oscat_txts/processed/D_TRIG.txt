Type Function module
Input IN: DWORD (input signal)
Output Q: BOOL (output)
X: DWORD (change of the input signal)
The function module D_ TRIG generates after a change at the input IN an 
output pulse for exactly one PLC cycle. The module works similar to the 
standard function blocks R_TRIG and F_TRIG and the library module 
B_TRIG. While B_TRIG, R_TRIG and F_TRIG monitor a Boolean input, the 
module D_TRIG triggers on any change in the DWORD-input IN. If the input 
value has changed, the output Q for a PLC cycle is set to TRUE and the 
output X indicates how much has changed in the IN input. The input and 
output are of type DWORD. The input can also process WORD and BYTE 
types. With output X it should be noted that DWORD is unsigned and 
therefore a change of -1 at the input is not -1, but the number 2^32-2 at 
the output. With the standard function DWORD_TO_INT the output X can 
be converted to an integer, which displays also negative changes correctly.
The following example shows the application of D_TRIG when the input
changes value from 5 to 2:
