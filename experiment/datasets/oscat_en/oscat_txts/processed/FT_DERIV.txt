Type Function module
Input IN: REAL (input signal)
K: REAL (multiplier)
RUN: BOOL (enable input)
Output OUT: REAL (derivation of the input signal K * X/  T ) 
FT_DERIV is a D-link, or LZI-transfer element, which has a diferentiating
transfer behavior. At the output of FT_DERIV the derivative is over time T
in seconds. When the input signal increases in one second from 3 to 4
then the output 1 * K (K *  X /  T = 1 * (4-3) / 1 = 1
In other words, the derivative of the input signal, the instantaneous slope
of the input signal. With the input RUN the FT_DERIV can be enabled or di￾sabled. FT_DERIV works internally in microseconds and fulfll also the re￾quirements of very fast PLC controller with cycle times under a millise￾cond.
