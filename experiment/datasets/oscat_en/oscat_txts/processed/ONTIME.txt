Type Function module
Input IN: BOOL (Input)
RST: BOOL (Reset input)
Output SECONDS: UDINT (operating time in seconds)
CYCLES: UDINT (switch cycles of the input IN)
ONTIME is an hour meter. It is summed up the entire time that the signal
IN was since the last RESET to TRUE. Additionally, the number of the total
on/of cycles is determined. The output values are of type UDINT. With the
input RST, the output values will be reset at any time. The output values
are not stored in variables of the module, but are applied externally atta￾ched and connected over IO (Pointer). This has the distinct advantage that
as desired by the user the variables can be determined as RETAIN or PER￾SISTENT. It is thus possible to store old operating hours and restore it la￾ter, for example, at CPU change.
The declaration of the variables at the inputs SECONDS and CYCLES must
be of type UDINT and can either be created as a VAR, VAR RETAIN or VAR
RETAIN PERSISTENT.
The declaration of the variables for the operating time and cycles must be
UDINT type and can be alternatively RETAIN or PERSISTENT.
VAR RETAIN PERSISTENT
Betriebszeit_in_Sekunden: UDINT;
Cycles: UDINT;
END_VAR
The following table explains, RETAIN and PERSISTENT:
Type variables Retain and Persistent retain their value during download,
online change and reset. In a cold reset or reset source, lose these varia-
bles the values. The user can save, but the values in the fle system or
network, and to restore itself, eg after changing the CPU.
