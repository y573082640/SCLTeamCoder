Type Function module
Input IN: BOOL (enable input)
VAL: Byte (maximum output value)
Setup PT_ON: TIME (rise time, Default is 100 ms) 
PT_OFF: TIME (fall time; Default is 100 ms) 
Output I/O
RMP_SOFT smooths the ramp of an input signal VAL. The signal Out follows
the input signal VAL, where increase time as well as fall time can be limi￾ted by PT_ON and PT_OFF . The rise time and fall time of the ramps are de￾fned by setup parameter in the module RMP_SOFT. The setup time PT_ON
specifes how long the ramp takes of 0..255. A ramp that is limited by the
VAL, is accordingly shorter. PT_OFF defnes accordingly the falling ramp. If
the input IN is set to FALSE, VAL corresponds to a value of 0, so by swit￾ching the input IN between 0 and VAL it can be switched.
