Input SET: BOOL (Asynchronous Set)
D: BOOL (Data in)
CLK: BOOL (clock input)
RST: BOOL (asynchronous reset)
Output Q : BOOL (Data Out)
FF_DRE is a edge-triggered D-Flip-Flop with Asynchronous Set and Reset
input. A rising edge at CLK stores the input D to output Q. A TRUE on the
SET or RST input resets or clears the output Q at any time regardless of
CLK. The reset input has priority over the input set. If both are active
(TRUE) are reset is processed and SET is ignored.
