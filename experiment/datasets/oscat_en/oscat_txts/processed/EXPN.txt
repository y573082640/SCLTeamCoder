Type Function: REAL
Input X: REAL (input)
N: INT (exponential)
Output REAL (result X^N)
EXPN calculates the exponential value of X^N for integer N. EXPN is espeï¿¾cifcally written for PLC without Floating Point Unit and is about 30 times
faster than the IEC standard function EXPT(). Note the special case of the
0^0 defned mathematically as a 1 and is not a 0. 
EXPN(10,-2) = 0.01 EXPN(1.5,2) = 2.25
EXPN(0,0) = 1
