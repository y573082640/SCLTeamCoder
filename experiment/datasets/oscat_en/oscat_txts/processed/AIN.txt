Type Function
Input IN: DWORD (input from the A / D converter)
Output REAL (output value)
Setup BITS: Bytes (number of bits, 16 for a complete word)
SIGN: Byte ( Sign Bit, 15 for Bit 15) 
LOW: REAL (minimum value of output)
High: REAL (largest value of output)
Analog inputs of A / D converters generally provide a WORD (16 bit) or
DWORD (32 bit), but they do not even usually 16 bit or 32 bit resolution.
Furthermore A/D converter digitizing a fxed input range (z as -10 .. + 10
V), which for example, the digital values 0 .. 65535 (In 16-bit). The AIN
function is confgured by setup parameters and calculates the output vaï¿¾lues of the A/D converter according to, so that after the AIN module a
REAL value is available, which corresponds to the real measured value.
Furthermore, the module can extract and convert a Sign- Bit at any point.
By double-clicking on the module, several setup variables can be defned.
Bits defnes how many bits of the input DWORD to be processed. For a 12
bit converter, this value is 12. Then only the bits 0 - 11 are scored. Sign
defnes whether a sign bit is present and where it is found in the input
word. Sign = 255 means that no sign bit is present and 15 means that bit
15 in the DWORD contains the sign. The default value for SIGN is 255.
LOW and HIGH defne the smallest and largest output value. If a Sign- Bit
is defned ( SIGN < 255), then LOW and HIGH must be positive. Without
Sign- Bit they can be either positive or negative. 
Example:
A 12-bit A/D converter without a sign and input range from 0-10 is defned
as follows: Bits = 12, Sign = 255, LOW = 0, HIGH = 10 
A 14-bit A/D converter with 14 bits with sign and input range -10 - +10 is
defned as: Bits = 14, Sign = 14, Low = 0, HIGH = +10. 
 A 24-bit A/D converter without sign and a input range -10 - +10 is defned
as: Bits = 24, Sign = 255, LOW =- 10, HIGH = +10.
