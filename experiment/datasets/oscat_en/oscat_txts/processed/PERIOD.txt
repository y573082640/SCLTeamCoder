Type Function: BOOL
Input D1: DATE (period begin)
DX: DATE (date to be tested)
D2: DATE (period end)
Output BOOL (TRUE if DX within the period D1 .. D2)
The function checks whether an input date DX is greater or equal than D1
and is less equal D2. If the date DX in the period between D1 and D2 (D1
and D2 included) is the output of the function TRUE. PERIOD ignores the
years in the dates D1, D2 and DX. The test is performed only for months
and days, so this function works for each year. The test period can also afï¿¾ter 31 Extend beyond December, so for example from 9/1 - 3/15, a typical
application is to determine whether there is a heating period. That PERIOD
work properly the two dates D1 and D2 may not be in a leap year. It can,
for example, always be 2001, or even any other year that is not a leap
year.
PERIOD (10/1/2001, 11/11/2007, 31/03/2001) returns TRUE, because the
test date within the period from 10/1 - 3/31 content.
