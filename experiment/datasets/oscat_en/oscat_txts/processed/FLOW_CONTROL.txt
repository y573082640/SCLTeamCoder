Type Function module
Input IN: BOOL (control input)
REQ: BOOL ( Request for automatic mode) 
ENQ: BOOL ( Enable for output Q) 
RST: BOOL (asynchronous reset input)
Setup T_AUTO: TIME (valve switch time in automatic mode)
T_DELAY: TIME(valve disable Time in automatic mode) 
Output Q: BOOL (switching output for valve)
STATUS: BYTE (ESR compliant status output)
FLOW_CONTROL switches a valve at the output Q when the input IN =
TRUE. In addition, the valve can also be switched via the input RE. REQ =
TRUE turns the valve on for the time T_AUTO and will be locked for the
time T_DELAY. after the time T_DELAY the valve can be turned on again on
REQ. During this lock period T_DELAY the valve may be controlled by the
input IN. An ESR compatible status output STATUS indicates the status of
the module. Both the REQ and IN can only switch the output Q when the
input ENQ is set to True.
Status = 100 Ready
Status = 101 Valve on by a TRUE at IN
Status = 102 Valve on by a TRUE at REQ
Status = 103 Reset is executed
