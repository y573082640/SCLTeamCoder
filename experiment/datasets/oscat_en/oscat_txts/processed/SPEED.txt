Type Function module
Input MS: REAL (meters / second)
KMH: REAL (kilometers / hour)
CN: REAL (knots = miles / hour)
MH: REAL (miles / hour)
Output YMS: REAL (meters / second)
YKMH : REAL (Kilometers / hour) 
YKN: REAL (knots = miles / hour)
YMH: REAL (miles / hour)
The module SPEED converts various common units in the units for speed.
Normally, only the input to be converted is occupied and the remaining in-
puts remain free. However, if several inputs loaded with values, the values
of all inputs are converted accordingly and then summed.
1 ms = meters / second = 3.6 km / h
1 kmh = kilometers / hour = 1 / 3, 6 m / s
1 knot = knot = 1 nautical mile / hour = 0.5144 m / s
Mh = 1 mile per hour = 0.44704 m / s
