Type Function: BOOL
Input X, Y: REAL (input)
N: INT (number of digits to be compared)
Output BOOL (result)
CMP compares two REAL values if the frst N points are equal.
Examples:
CMP(3.140,3.149,3) = TRUE CMP(3.140,3.149,4) = FALSE
CMP(0.015,0,016,1) = TRUE CMP(0.015,0,016,2) = FALSE
In the CMP function note that the dual coding of numbers a 0.1 in the deci￾mal system can not necessarily always displayed as 0.1 in the binary sys￾tem. Rather, it may happen that represented something less than 0.1 or
greater because the resolution is not the number in binary coding allows
exactly one 0.1. For this reason, the function can not detect for 100% the
diference of 1 in the last position. In addition, note that a data type REAL
with 32 bit has only a resolution of 7 - 8 decimal places.
