FSTRING_TO_WEEK decode a list of days on the form 'MO,TU,3'in a Bitpat￾tern (bit6 = MO...Bit0 = So) For the evaluation each of the frst two letters
of the list elements are evaluated, the rest are ignored. If the string con￾tains spaces they will be removed. The days of the week can be present in
both upper-or lowercase. LANG specifes the language used, 1 = English, 2
= German, 0 is the default language defned in the setup.
Mo = 1; Di, Tu = 2; We, Mi = 3; Th, Do = 4; Fr = 5; Sa = 6; So, Su = 7
Since the function evaluates only the frst two characters, the weekdays
may also be spelled out (Monday) format.
As an alternative form, the weekday can be specifed as number 1..7.
The list includes the weekdays unsorted and separated by commas.
FSTRING_TO_WEEK ('Mo,Tu,Sa',2) = 2#01100010.
