Type Function module
Input IN: BOOL (Input)
TC: TIME (time in which the clicks must take place) 
Output Q0: BOOL (output signal rising edge
without falling edge)
Q1: BOOL (output signal of a pulse within TC)
Q2: BOOL (output signal for two pulses within TC)
Q3: BOOL (output signal for three pulses within TC)
CLICK_DEC decodes multiple keystrokes and signals to diferent outputs
the number of pulses. An input signal without falling edge within TC is is￾sued at Q0 and remains TRUE until IN goes on FALSE. A pulse followed by
a TRUE is output to Q1 and so on. Is a pulse registered within TC which is
followed by the state FALSE, then TRUE appear at the corresponding out￾put for a PLC cycle.
