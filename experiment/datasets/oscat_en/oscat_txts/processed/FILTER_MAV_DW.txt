FILTER_MAV_DW is a flter with moving average. The flter with moving
average (also Moving Average Filter called) the average of N successive
readings is output as an average. 
Y:= (X0 + X1 + … + Xn-1) / N
X0 is the value of X in the current cycle, X1 is the value in the previous cy￾cle, etc. The number of values over which the average has to be calcula￾ted is specifed at the input N. The range of values of N is between 1 and
