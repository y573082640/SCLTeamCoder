Type Function : REAL
Input T: REAL (air temperature in ° C)
P: REAL (air pressure in Pascal)
RH: REAL (humidity in %)
Output (Density of air in kg / m³)
AIR_DENSITY calculates the density of air in kg / m³ depending on pressu￾re, humidity and temperature. The temperature is given in ° C, pressure in
Pascal and the humidity in % (50 = 50%).
