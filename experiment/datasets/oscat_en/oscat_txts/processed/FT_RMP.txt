Type Function module
Input RMP: BOOL ( Enable Signal) 
IN: REAL (input signal)
KR: REAL (rate of increase in 1 / seconds)
TV: REAL (speed of the drop in 1 / seconds)
Output OUT_MAX: REAL (upper output limit)
BUSY: BOOL (Indicates if the output rises or falls)
UD: BOOL (TRUE, when output is rising and false if 
Output drops)
The output OUT follows the input with a linear ramp with defned rise and
fall speed (KR and KF). K = 1 means that the output increases with 1 unit
per second, or falls. The K factor must be greater than 0. The output of UD
is TRUE if the output is rising and FALSE if it drops. When the output rea￾ches the input value is BUSY FALSE, otherwise BUSY is TRUE and indicates
that a rising or falling ramp is active.
The output follows the input signal as long as the rise and fall speed of the
input signal is smaller than that by KR and KF defned maximum increase
or decrease speed. Changing the input signal faster, the output runs at
the speed of KR or KF after the input signal. The ramp generation is real￾time, which means that FT_RMP calculates every time where the output
should be and sets this value to the output. The main change is therefore
dependent on the cycle time and is not in equal steps. If a ramp out of
sheer same steps are required, are the modules RMP_B and RMP_W are
available. The module is only active when the input RMP = TRUE.
The following chart shows the profle of the output as a function of an in￾put signal:
