Input IN0: DWORD (bit sequence for Q0)
IN1: DWORD (bit sequence for Q1)
IN2: DWORD (bit sequence for Q1)
IN3: DWORD (bit sequence for Q1)
CLK: BOOL (clock input)
STEPS: INT (number of generated clocks)
REP: INT
RST: BOOL
Output Q0: BOOL (bit sequence Q0)
Q1: BOOL (bit sequence Q1)
Q2: BOOL (bit sequence Q2)
Q3: BOOL (bit sequence Q3)
CNT: INT (number of output bits already generated)
RUN: BOOL (TRUE if the sequencer is running)
GEN_BIT is a fully programmable pattern generator. At the inputs in0 .. IN7
are the bit patterns at the input CLK in each case as a DWORD and passed
by each clock pulse to the outputs Q0 .. Q3 starting from bit 0 of ascen￾ding. After the frst clock pulse at the input CLK the output Q0 has bit 0 of
IN0 , at Q1 is bit 0 of In1 ... on Q7 is bit 0 of IN3. After the next clock pulse
at the CLK input, the bit 1 of the inputs IN is passed to the outputs Q and
so on, until the sequence is completed. The input STEPS determines how
many bits of the input DWORDS be passed to the outputs. The input REP
determines how often this sequence is repeated. If the input set to 0, the
sequence is repeated continuously. An asynchronous reset can always re￾set the sequencer. The outputs CNT and RUN indicate which bit is current￾ly passed to the output and whether the sequencer is running, or the se￾quence (RUN inactive) has fnished. After the sequences have expired the
last bit patterns remains on the outputs available until a reset restarts the
generator.
Example:
In this example, the lowest 8 bits (bits 0 .. 7) at the inputs IN are pushed
to the outputs Q. The sequence begins with bit 0 and ends at bit 7 (8
Steps are defned by the input 8). This sequence is repeated 2 times (2 re￾petitions at the input REP) and then stopped. 
The Trace Recording shows the reset signal becoming inactive (green),
which starts the generator and after the frst clock pulse passes bit 0 to
the outputs.
