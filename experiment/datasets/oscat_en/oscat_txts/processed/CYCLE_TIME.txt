Type Function module
Input RES: BOOL (Reset)
Output CT_MIN: TIME (minimum measured cycle time)
CT_MAX: TIME (maximum measured cycle time)
CT_LAST: TIME (recently measured cycle time)
SYSTIME: TIME (duration since last start)
SYSDAYS: INT (number of days since last start)
CYCLES: DWORD (number of cycles since the last start)
CYCLE_TIME monitors the cycle time of a PLC and provides the user with a
range of information about cycle times and run times. The total number of
cycles is also measured. Hereby, the user can, for example ensure that a
function is called every 100 cycles. Control modules can report errors if
the cycle time is too long and therefore the control parameters can not be
guaranteed.
