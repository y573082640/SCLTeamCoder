Type Function
Input X: REAL (input)
XY: ARRAY [1..20,0..1] (Ascending sorted values pairs)
PTS: INT (number of pairs of values)
Output REAL (output)
LINEAR_INT is a linear interpolation module. A characteristic is described
by a maximum of 20 coordinate values (X, Y) and is cut up to 19 linear
segments. The defnition of the coordinate values is passed in an array
which describes the characteristic with individual X, Y describes value
pairs. The value pairs must be sorted by the x_value. If an X value is called
outside range which is described by the value pairs, then the frst respecti￾ve last linear segment is extrapolated and the corresponding value Issued.
To keep the number of defnition points fexible, at the input PTS is given
the number of points. The possible score is in the range from 3 to 20, whe￾rein each individual dot is shown with X-and Y-value.
Example:
VAR
 BEISPIEL : ARRAY[1..20,0..1] := -10,-0.53, 10,0.53, 100,88.3,
200,122.2;
END_VAR
for the above defnition, the following results are valid:
LINEAR_INT (0, example, 4) = 0;
LINEAR_INT (30.0, example, 4) = 20.0344;
LINEAR_INT (66.41, example, 4) = 55.54229;
LINEAR_INT (66.41, example, 4) = 55.54229;
