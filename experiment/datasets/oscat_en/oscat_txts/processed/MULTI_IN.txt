Type Function: REAL
Input IN_1: REAL (input 1)
IN_2: REAL (input 2)
IN_3: REAL (input 3)
DEFAULT: REAL (default value)
IN_MIN: REAL (lower limit for inputs)
IN_MAX: REAL (upper limit for inputs)
MODE: Byte (selection of the operating mode)
Output REAL (output)
MULTI_IN is a sensor interface that accepts up to 3 sensors to check for er￾rors, and depending on the input mode, an output value is calculated.
Mode Function
0 MULTI_in = average of the inputs in_1.. 3
1 MULTI_in = input in_1
2 MULTI_in = input in_2
3 MULTI_in = input in_3
4 MULTI_in = Default Input 
5 MULTI_in = smallest value of the inputs in_1.. 3
6 MULTI_in = largest value of the inputs in_1 .. 3
7 MULTI_in = mean value of the inputs in_1..3
>7 MULTI_in = 0
Regardless of the mode input values that are greater than IN_MAX or less
than IN_MIN be ignored. If no calculation is possible as defned by mode,
the input Default is used as a output value. Multi_in is used when diferent
sensors measures the same value and high security and reliability is requi￾red. A possible application is to measure the outside temperature at va￾rious points and the surveillance on cable or sensor failure.
