Type Function: DINT
Input X: REAL (input)
Output DINT (output value)
D _TRUNC returns the integer value of a REAL value as DINT. The IEC 
routine TRUNC() does not supports on all systems a TRUNC to DINT so that 
we have rebuilt this routine for compatibility. Unfortunately, even 
REAL_TO_DINT does not give on all systems the same result. D_TRUNC 
reviewes what result the IEC functions provides, and uses the appropriate 
function to deliver a useful result.
D_TRUNC(1.6) = 1
D_TRUNC(-1.6) = -1
