Type Function module
Input IN: REAL (input signal)
DI: DATE (date input)
RST: BOOL (Reset input)
I / O LAST_DAY: REAL (consumption value of the previous day)
CURRENT_DAY: REAL (consumption value of the current day)
LAST_WEEK: REAL (consumption value over the past week)
CURRENT_WEEK: REAL (consumption value of the current
week)
LAST_MONTH: REAL (consumption value of the last month)
CURRENT_MONTH: REAL (consumption of the current month)
LAST_YEAR: REAL (consumption value of last year)
Current_year: REAL (consumption value of the current year)
METER_STAT calculates the consumption of the current day, week, month
and year and shows the value of the last corresponding period. The accu￾mulated consumption value is at the IN input, while at the DI input is app￾lied the current date. With the RST input, the counter can be reset at any
time. For ease of storage in the persistent and retentive memory, the out￾puts are defned as I / O.
The following example shows the application of METER_STAT with the mo￾dule METER:
