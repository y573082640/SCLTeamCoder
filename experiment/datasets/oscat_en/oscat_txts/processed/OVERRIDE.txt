Type Function
Input X1: REAL (input signal 1)
X2: REAL (Input signal 2)
X3: REAL (input signal 3)
E1: BOOL ( Enable Signal 1) 
E2: BOOL ( Enable Signal 2) 
E2: BOOL ( Enable Signal 3) 
Output REAL (output value
OVERRIDE supplies at the output Y the input value (X1, X2, X3), whose ab￾solute value is the largest of all. The inputs X1, X2 and X3 may each indivi￾dually be enabled with the inputs E1, E2 and E3. if one of the input signals
E1, E2 or E3 to FALSE, the corresponding input X1, X2 or X3 is not conside￾red. One of many possible applications of OVERRIDE is for example, the
query of three sensors with the highest value overrides the others. With
the inputs of E in the diagnosis case, each sensor can be queried indivi￾dually, or a defective sensor can be switched of.
Example:
OVERRIDE(10,-12,11, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE) = -12
OVERRIDE(10,-12,11, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) = 11
OVERRIDE(10,-12,11, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE) = 0
