Type Function module
Input IN: REAL (input signal)
RES: REAL (input change)
Output Q: BOOL (output)
D: REAL (last change of the input signal)
A_TRIG monitors an input value on change and every time when the input
value changes by more than RES, the module generates an output pulse
for a cycle so that the new value can be processed. At the same time, the
device remembers the current input value with which it compares with the
input IN at the next cycle. At the output D the diference between IN and
the stored value is displayed.
