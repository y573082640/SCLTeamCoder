Type Function : REAL
Input T: REAL (air temperature in ° C)
ICE: BOOL (TRUE for air over ice and FALSE for air over
water)
Output REAL (saturation vapor pressure in Pa)
SDD calculates the saturation vapor pressure for water vapor in air. The
temperature T is given in Celsius. The result can be calculated for air over
ice (ICE = TRUE) and for air to water (ICE = FALSE). The scope of the func￾tion is -30°C to 70°C over water and at -60°C to 0°C on ice. The calculati￾on is performed according to the Magnus formula.
