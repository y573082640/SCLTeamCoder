Type Function : REAL
Input RH: REAL (Relative Humidity)
T: REAL (temperature in °C)
Output REAL (water vapor concentration in g/m³)
The module DEW_CON calculates from the relative humidity (RH) and 
temperature (T in °C) water vapor concentration in the air. The result is 
calculated in grams/m³. RH is shown in % (50 = 50%) and indicates the 
temperature in °C.
The module is suitable for temperatures from -40°C to +90°C.
