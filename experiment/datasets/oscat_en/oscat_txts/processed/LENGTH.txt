The module LENGTH converts diferent in common used units for units of
length. Normally, only the input to be converted is occupied and the reï¿¾maining inputs remain free. However, if several inputs loaded with values,
the values of all inputs are converted accordingly and then summed.
1 P = 0.376065 mm (unit from the printing industry)
1 IN = 25,4 mm
1 FT = 0,3048 m
1 YD = 0,9144 m
1 MILE = 1609,344 m
1 SM = 1852 m
1 FM = 1,829 m
