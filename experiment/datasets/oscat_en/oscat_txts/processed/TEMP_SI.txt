Type Function: REAL
Input RES: REAL (measured resistance in ohms)
RS: REAL (resistance at 0°C)
TS: REAL (temperature is defned in RS)
Output REAL (measured temperature)
TEMP_SI calculates the temperature of a resistor sensor input values from
the RES (resistance in ohms) and RS, Resistance at TS in °C. It is specifed
in contrast to the modules TEMP_NI and TEMP_PT with their R0 at 0°, the
resistance RS is given in SI sensors at diferent temperatures (eg 25° C for
KTY10). Therefore, the module has an input for RS and another for TS.
The calculation is done using the formula:
RES_SI = RS + A*(T-TS) + B*(T-TS)²
A = 7.64E-3; B = 1.66E-5
The calculation is suitable for temperatures from -50.. +150 °C.
