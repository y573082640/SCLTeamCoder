Type Function: INT
Input X: REAL (input)
Output REAL (result of Sigmoid )
The Sigmoid is also named Gooseneck - function and described by the fol￾lowing equation: 
SIGMOID = 1 / (1 + EXP(-X))
The Sigmoid is often used as activation function. By its behavior the
Sigmoid is qualifed for soft switching transitions.
The following chart illustrates the progress of the Sigmoid :
