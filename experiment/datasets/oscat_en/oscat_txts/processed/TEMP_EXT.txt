T_EXT_MAX: REAL (maximum outside temperature)
T_EXT_DEFAULT: REAL (default external temperature)
HEAT_PERIOD_START: DATE (start of heating season)
HEAT_PERIOD_STOP: DATE (end of heating season)
COOL_PERIOD_START: DATE (start of cooling period)
COOL_PERIOD_STOP: DATE (end of cooling period)
HEAT_START_TEAMP_DAY (heating trigger temperature day)
HEAT_START_TEAMP_NIGHT (heating trigger temperature night)
HEAT_STOP_TEMP: REAL (heating stop temperature)
COOL_START_TEAMP_DAY (cooling start temperature day)
COOL_START_TEMP_NIGHT (cooling start temperature night)
COOL_STOP_TEMP: REAL (cooling stop temperature)
START_DAY: TOD (start of the day)
START_NIGHT: TOD (early night)
CYCLE_TIME: TIME (query time for outside temperature)
TEMP_EXT processes up to 3 remote temperature sensor and provides by
mode a selected external temperature to the heating control. It calculates
signals for heating and cooling depending on outdoor temperature, date
and time. With the input T_EXT_Setup is defned how the output value
T_EXT is determined. If T_EXT_Setup is not connected, then the default va￾lue 0. The setup values T_EXT_MIN and T_EXT_Max set the minimum and
maximum value of the external temperature inputs. If these limits are ex￾ceeded or not reached, a fault in the sensor or broken wire is assumed and
instead of measured valued the default value T_EXT_DEFAULT is used. 
T_EXT_Setup T_EXT
0 Average of T_EXT1, T_ext2 and T_ext3
1 T_EXT1
2 T_EXT2
3 T_EXT3
4 T_EXT_DEFAULT
5 Lowest value of the 3 inputs
6 Highest value of 3 inputs
7 Average value of 3 inputs
With the setup variables HEAT_PERIOD and COOL_PERIOD is defnes when
heating and when cooling is allowed. The decision, whether the output
HEAT or COOL gets TRUE, still depends on the setup values HEAT_START -
HEAT_STOP and COOL_START and COOL_STOP. These values can be def￾ned separately for day and night. The start of a day and night period can
be determined by the setup variables START_DAY and START_NIGHT. A va￾riable CYCLE_TIME specifes how often the outside temperature to be que￾ried.
