Type Function: DINT
Input X: INT (input)
Output DINT (Fibonacci numbers)
FIB calculate the Fibonacci number The Fibonacci number is defned as folï¿¾lows:
FIB(0) = 0, FIB(1) = 1, FIB(2) = 1, FIB(3) = 2, FIB(4) = 3, FIB(5) = 5 .....
The Fibonacci number of X is equal to the sum of the Fibonacci numbers of
X-1 and X-2. The function can compute the Fibonacci numbers up to 46, if
X < 0 or greater than 46, the function returns -1.
