Type Function module
Input ENQ: BOOL ( Enable Input) 
PTH: TIME (pulse duration HIGH)
PTL: TIME (pulse duration LOW)
Output Q: BOOL (output)
GEM_PULSE generates at the output Q, an output signal which sets in the
time of PTH to TRUE and then set for PTL to LOW. The generator will start
after ENQ = TRUE always with a rising edge at Q, and remains for the time
PTH to TURE. As long as ENQ = TRUE continuous pulses at the output Q
are generated. Is one of the times (PTH, PTL) or both equal to 0 the time
will limit to one PLC cycle. GEN_PULSE (ENQ: = TRUE, PTH: = T # 0s, PTL:
= T # 0s) generates an output signal which has one cycle TRUE and one
cycle FALSE. The Default ENQ value is TRUE.
