Type Function: REAL
Input X: REAL (input)
N: integer (number of digits)
Output REAL (rounded value)
The function R ND rounds the input value IN to N digits. Follows the last
point a number that is greater than 5, the last digit is rounded up. RND in￾ternally uses the standard function TRUNC() which converts the input va￾lue to an INTEGER type DINT. This may come as an overfow because DINT
can store in maximum +/-2.14*10^9. The range of the RND is therefore li-
mited to +/-2.14*10^9 . See also the ROUND function which rounds the in￾put value to N decimal places. 
Example: RND(355.55, 2) = 360
RND(3.555, 2) = 3.6
ROUND(3.555, 2) = 3.56
