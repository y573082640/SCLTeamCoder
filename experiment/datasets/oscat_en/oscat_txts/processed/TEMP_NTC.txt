Type TEMP_NTC
Input RES: REAL (measured resistance in ohms)
RN: REAL (resistance of the sensor at 25°C)
B: REAL (specifcation of the sensor)
Output REAL (measured temperature)
TEMP_NTC calculates from the measured resistance and the parameters of
the sensor, the measured temperature. RN is the resistance of the sensor
at 25°C, and B depends on the sensor and the specifcation of the sensor.
The module calculates the temperature according to the following formu￾la:
