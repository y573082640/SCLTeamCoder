Type Function: REAL
Input A: REAL (input value of 1)
B: REAL (input value 2)
M: REAL (ratio)
Output REAL (value from the mixing ratio M between A and B)
MIX provides at the output a mixed ratio M value, mixed from values A and
B. The input M passes the proportion of B in the range 0..1.
MIX = (M-1)*A + M*B
