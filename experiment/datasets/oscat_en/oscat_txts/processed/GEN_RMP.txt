Type Function module
Input PT: TIME (period time)
AM: REAL (signal amplitude)
OS: REAL (signal ofset)
DL: REAL (signal delay 0..1 * PT )
Output Q: BOOL (binary output)
OUT: REAL (analog output)
GEN_RMP is a sawtooth generator. It generates a ramp at the output OUT 
with the duration of PT and repeats this continuously. The output Q is for 
exactly one cycle TRUE when the ramp starts at the output OUT. The input 
AM and OS set the amplitude and the ofset for the output OUT. If the 
inputs OS and AM are not connected the default values are 0 and 1. The 
output OUT then generates a sawtooth signal of 0 .. 1. The input DL can 
move the output up to a period (PT) and is used to produce multiple 
shifted signals to each other. A 0 at the input DL means no displacement. 
A value between 0 and 1 shifts the signal by up to a period. 
The following example shows a trace recording of the input values PT =
10s, AM = 1 and OS = 0
