Type Function module
Input LATITUDE: REAL (latitude of the reference location)
 LONGITUDE : REAL (longitude of the reference location) 
UTC: DATE_TIME (Universal Time)
Output B: REAL (azimuth in degrees from North)
H: REAL (Astronomical sun height)
HR: REAL (solar altitude in degrees above the horizon with re￾fraction)
SUN_POS calculated the position of the sun (B, H) at the current time. The
time is expressed as Universal Time (UTC). Any possible local time must
frst be converted to UTC. At the sun position HR, the atmospheric refracti￾on for 1010mbar and 10°C is already taken into account. The accuracy is
better than 0.1 degrees for the period from 2000 to 2050. Possible appli￾cations of SUN_POS are the tracking of solar panels or a sun dependent
tracking of the slats of blinds. SUN_POS is a complicated algorithm, but
delivers the exact values. To keep the load of a PLC as low as possible, the
calculation can be performed, for example, only every 10 seconds, which
corresponds to an uncertainty of 0.04 degrees. The output B passes the
solar angle in degrees from north (south = 180 °). H is the Astronomical
angle above the horizon (the horizon = 0 °). HR is the sun above the hori￾zon to the atmospheric corrected by the refraction (refraction). An obser￾ver on the Earth sees the sun in a, by the refraction raised position, of the
horizon, which will cause the sun is shining already, but it is still slightly
below the horizon.
