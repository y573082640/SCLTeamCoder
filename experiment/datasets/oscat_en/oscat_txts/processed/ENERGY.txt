Type Function module
Input J: REAL (Joule)
C: REAL (calorie)
WH: REAL (Watt hours)
Output YJ: REAL (Joule)
YC: REAL (calorie)
YWH: REAL (Watt hours)
The module converts ENERGY in diferent, in practice common units of
energy. Normally, only the input to be converted is occupied and the reï¿¾maining inputs remain free. However, if several inputs loaded with values,
the values of all inputs are converted accordingly and then summed.
1 J = 1 Ws (Watt * Seconds) = 1 Nm (Newton * meters)
1 C = 4,1868 J = 1,163 * 10 -3 Wh (watt * hours) 
1 Wh = 3,6 * 103 J = 860 C
