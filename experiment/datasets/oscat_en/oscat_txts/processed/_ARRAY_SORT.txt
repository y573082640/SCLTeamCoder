Type Function: BOOL
Input PT: Pointer (pointer to the array)
SIZE: UINT (size of the array)
Output BOOL (TRUE)
The function _array_SORT sorts an arbitrary array of REAL in ascending or￾der. When called, a pointer to the array and its size in bytes is transferred
to the function. Under CoDeSys the call is: _ARRAY_SORT(ADR(Array), SI￾ZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of the array to be manipulated.
ADR() is a standard function which identifes the pointer to the array and
SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines the size of the array.
The function only returns TRUE. The array specifed by the pointer is mani￾pulated directly in memory. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
Example: _ARRAY_SHUFFLE (ADRs(bigarray), SIZEOF(bigarray))
