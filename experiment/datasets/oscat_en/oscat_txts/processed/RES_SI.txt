Type Function: REAL
Input T: REAL (temperature in °C)
RS: REAL (Resistance at TS °C)
TS: REAL (temperature at RS)
Output REAL (resistance)
RES_SI calculates the resistance of a SI-resistance sensor from the input
values T (temperature in °C) and RS, resistance at TS in °C. In contrast to
the modules RES_NI and RES_PT which R0 is given at 0°C, the resistance
specifed for RS for SI sensors at diferent temperatures (eg 25°C for
KTY10). Therefore, the module has an input for RS and another for TS.
The calculation is done using the formula:
RES_SI = RS + A*(T-TS) + B*(T-TS)²
A = 7.64E-3
B = 1.66E-5
The calculation is suitable for a temperature range of -50 .. +150°C.
