Type Function : REAL
Input T: REAL (water temperature in °C)
Output REAL (Specifc heat capacity at temperature T)
WATER_CP calculates the specifc heat capacity of liquid water as a functi￾on of temperature at atmospheric pressure. The calculation is valid in the
temperature range from 0 to 100 degrees Celsius and is calculated in
joules / (gram * kelvin). The temperature T is given in Celsius.
