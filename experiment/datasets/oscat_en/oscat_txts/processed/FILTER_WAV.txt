Type Function: REAL
Input X: DWORD (input)
W: array [0...15] of real (weighting factors)
RST: BOOL (asynchronous reset input)
Output Y: REAL (fltered value)
FILTER_WAV is a flter with a weighted average. (Also called FIR flter) the
flter with a weighted average of individual values in the bufer are evalua￾ted with diferent weights.
Y:= X0 * W0 + X1 * W1 + ….+ X15 * W15
X0 is the value of X in the current cycle, X1 is the value in the previous cy￾cle, etc. The factors W are passed as the input array W. In applying the FIR
flter hast to be ensured that appropriate factors are used for weighting.
The application makes sense only if these factors are determined by ap￾propriate methods or design software.
