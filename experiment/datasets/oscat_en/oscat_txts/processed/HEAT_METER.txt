Type Function : REAL
Input TF: REAL (fow temperature in °C)
TR: REAL (back fow temperature in °C)
LPH: REAL (Flow in L/h or L/pulse)
E: BOOL ( Enable Signal) 
RST: BOOL (asynchronous reset input)
Setup CP: REAL (Specifc heat capacity 2nd component)
DENSITY: REAL (density of the 2nd component)
CONTENT: REAL (share, 1 = 100%)
PULSE_MODE: BOOL (pulse counter if TRUE)
RETURN_METER: BOOL (fow meter in the return
if TRUE)
AVG_TIME: TIME (time interval for current consumption)
Output C: REAL (current consumption in joules/hour)
I / O Y: REAL (amount of heat in joules)
HEAT_METER is a calorimeter. The amount of heat Y is measured in joules.
The inputs of TF and TR are the forward and return temperature of the me￾dium. At the input LPH the fow rate in liters/hour, resp. the fow rate per
pulse of E is specifed. The property of E is determined by the Setup Varia￾ble PULSE_MODE. PULSE_MODE = FALSE means the amount of heat is ad￾ded continuously as long as E is set to TRUE. PULSE_MODE = TRUE means
the amount of heat with each rising edge of E is added up. The
PULSE_MODE is turned on the use of heat meters, while indicating the fow
rate in liters per pulse at the input LPH and the heat meter is connected
at the input E. If no fow meter is present, the the pump signal is connec￾ted at input E and at the input LPH given the pump capacity in liters per
hour. When using a fow meter with analog output is the output to be con￾verted to liters per hour and sent to the input LPH, the input E will be set
to TRUE. With the setup variables CP, DENSITY and CONTENT the 2nd
component of the medium is specifed. For operation with pure water no
details of CP, DENSITY and CONTENT are necessary. [fzy] If a mixture of
water and a 2nd media is present, with CP the specifc heat capacity in
J/KgK, with DENSITY the density in KG/l and with CONTENT the portion of
the 2nd component is specifed. A proportion of 0.5 means 50% and 1
would be equivalent to 100%. The setup variables RETURN_METER is spe￾cifed whether the fow meter sits in forward or reverse. RETRUN_METER =
TRUE for return measurement and FALSE for fow measurement. The out￾put C of the module represents the current consumption. The current con￾sumption is measured in joules/hour, and is determined at the intervals of
AVG_TIME. 
The module has the following default values that are active when the cor￾responding values are not set by the user:
PULSE_MODE = FALSE
RETURN_METER = FALSE
AVG_TIME = T#5s
