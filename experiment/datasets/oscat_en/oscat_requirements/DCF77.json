  "title": "DCF77 Time Receiver Function Block",
  "description": "This function block processes DCF77 time signals and updates the real-time clock (RTC) with data obtained from the DCF77 signal. It handles signal reception, time decoding, and generates output signals indicating the current date and time. The block manages synchronization, daylight saving time adjustments, and error conditions that may arise from invalid signals.",
