  "description": "This function performs a band operation on two BYTE inputs, X and B. It returns a BYTE result based on the comparison of these inputs. If X is less than B, the result is 0. If X exceeds the maximum allowable value after subtracting B from 255, the result is capped at 255. Otherwise, the function returns X.",
