  "description": "This function block implements a first-order proportional-derivative (PD) controller. It takes an input signal and applies proportional gain and differentiator characteristics to produce an output signal. The user can configure the proportional gain (KP) and the time constant for the derivative (TV). The output of the controller (Y) is calculated based on the difference of the input signal and the proportional gain.",
