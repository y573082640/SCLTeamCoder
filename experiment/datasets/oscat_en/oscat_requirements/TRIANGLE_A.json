  "description": "This function calculates the area of a triangle based on two methods: either using the lengths of all three sides or using one side and the included angle. If the angle A is 0, the area is calculated using Heron's formula. Otherwise, it uses the formula with side lengths S1 and S2 and the included angle A.",
