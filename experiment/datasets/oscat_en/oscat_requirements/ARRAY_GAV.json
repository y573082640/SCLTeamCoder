  "description": "This function computes the geometric average of a given array of real numbers. It takes a pointer to an array and its size as inputs. If any element of the array is less than or equal to zero, the function returns a geometric average of zero. Otherwise, it computes the geometric average by multiplying all positive elements and taking the nth root, where n is the number of elements processed.",
