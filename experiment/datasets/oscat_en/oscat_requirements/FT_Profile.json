  "title": "FT_Profile Function Block",
  "description": "The FT_Profile function block is designed to generate a variable profile based on a sequence of time-value pairs. It calculates interpolated values over a specified duration, based on input values and timing conditions, and provides an output value that reflects this profile. The block initiates a run sequence based on a trigger and maintains the state of the profile execution until completion or reset.",
