  "description": "This function block generates a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal based on a defined frequency (F) and duty cycle (DC). It calculates the time period for a given frequency and uses it to configure and control a clock signal, which is then used to create a pulse signal. The output signal indicates the state of the pulse.",
