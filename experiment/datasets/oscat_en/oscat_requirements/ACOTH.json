  "title": "Calculate the Inverse Hyperbolic Cotangent",
  "description": "This function computes the inverse hyperbolic cotangent (ACOTH) of a given real number X. The result is calculated using the natural logarithm of the expression (X + 1) divided by (X - 1), scaled by 0.5. It takes a single real number as input and returns a real number as output.",
