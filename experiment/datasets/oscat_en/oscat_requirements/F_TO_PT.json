  "title": "Function to Convert Frequency to Period Time",
  "description": "This function calculates the period time based on a given frequency. The input frequency is provided in Hertz (REAL), and the function outputs the corresponding period time in TIME format. The calculation involves converting the frequency to a period using the formula: period_time = 1 / frequency * 1000, where the result is then converted from DWORD to TIME format.",
