  "title": "Calculate Harmonic Average of an Array",
  "description": "This function calculates the harmonic average of a given array of real numbers. It takes as input a pointer to the array and its size. The function iterates through the array elements, summing the reciprocals of the non-zero elements. If a zero element is encountered, the function immediately returns a harmonic average of zero. Otherwise, it divides the total count of valid elements by the sum of their reciprocals to produce the final harmonic average.",
