  "description": "This function block measures timing intervals based on input signals and produces various timing outputs. It takes an input signal that can change state and computes the time between rising and falling edges, as well as provides information about duty cycle and frequency. The function block can be reset with an external reset signal and limits the maximum timing duration.",
