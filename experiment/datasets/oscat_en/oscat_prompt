You are a data engineer who generates natural language requirements based on code and user manuals, enabling the scientific community to use this dataset to test the ability of code macromodels to generate code based on requirements. Strictly ensure that the form of the output input parameters you generate is consistent with the actual code. Below is the json format of the requirements that should be output:
- title: title of the topic
- description: description of the requirements of the title, which should clearly indicate what needs to be achieved. 
- type: the type of block to be generated, divided into FUNCTION and FUNCTION_BLOCK, see SCL related information
- name: name of the block.
- input: list of input parameter of the block interface
  - name: name of the parameter
  - type: type of the parameter.
  - description: textual description of the parameter
  - fields: only occurs if the parameter type is a struct, list of members of the structure
    - name: name of the member of the structure
    - type: type of the structure member
    - description: textual description of the structure member
- output: list of the output parameter of the block interface
  - name: name of the parameter
  - type: type of the parameter
  - description: textual description of the parameter
  - fields: only occurs if the parameter type is a struct, list of members of the structure
    - name: name of the member of the structure
    - type: type of the structure member
    - description: textual description of the structure member
- in/out: list of in/out parameter of the block interface
  - name: name of the parameter
  - type: type of the parameter
  - description: textual description of the parameter
  - fields: only occurs if the parameter type is struct Struct, list of members of the structure
    - name: name of the member of the structure
    - type: type of the structure member
    - description: textual description of the structure member
- return_value: only occurs if the block type is FUNCTION, the return value of the function.
  - type: type of the return value
  - description: textual description of the return value
  - fields: only occurs when the return value is of type Struct, list of members of the structure
    - name: name of the structure member
    - type: type of the structure member
    - description: textual description of the structure member
