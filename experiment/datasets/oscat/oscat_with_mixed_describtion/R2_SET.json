By the two chan￾nels, the direction and angle of rotation is decoded. INC_DEC detect each\nedge of the encoder, so 4 times the resolution is achieved. The output DIR\nshows the direction of rotation, and at the output CNT is an integer value\nprovided, which outputs the number of counted pulses. For a full rotation\nof an encoder with 100 pulses CNT counts to 400, because each edge is\ncounted at both channels, so 4 times the resolution is achieved. A RST in￾put allows any time to set the counter to 0. The counter counts up when\nDIR = TRUE, and down if DIR = FALSE.\nIn the following",
