If the string\nSTR is shorter than the length L to be created, will the string be flled de￾pending on M, with the fll character C. If M = 0, the padding at the end of\nthe string is appended, if M = 1, the padding is attached the beginning\nand when M = 2, the string is centered between fll character. If the num￾ber of the necessary padding is odd and if M = 2, the fll at the end has a\nfll character more than at the beginning. The FIX function evaluates the\nGlobal Setup string_length constant and limits the maximum length L of\nthe string to string_length.",
