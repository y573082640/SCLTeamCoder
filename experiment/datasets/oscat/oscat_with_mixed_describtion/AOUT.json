Furthermore, the module can insert a Sign- Bit\nanywhere if the D/A converter need a Sign- Bit. By double-clicking on the\nmodule, several setup variables can be defned. Bits defne how many Bits\nthe D/A converter can handle. For a 12 bit converter, this value is 12. Then\nonly the bits 0 - 11 are scored. Sign defnes whether a sign bit is needed\nand where to place in the source DWORD. Sign = 255 means that no sign\nbit is needed, and 15 means Bit 15 in the DWORD contains the sign. LOW\nand HIGH defne the smallest and highest input value. If a Sign-Bit is defï¿¾ned ( SIGN< 255), then LOW and HIGH must be positive. Without Sign-Bit\nthey can be either positive or negative.",
