    "description": "_ARRAY_ABS calculates the elements of an arbitrary array Of\nREAL in an absolute value. When called, a pointer to the array and its size\nin bytes is transferred to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads: _AR￾RAY_ABS(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(array)), where array is the name of the array\nto be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which identifes the poin￾ter to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines the\nsize of the array. The function only returns TRUE. The array specifed by\nthe pointer is manipulated directly in memory. \nThis type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.\nCall: _ARRAY_ABS(ADR(bigarray), SIZEOF(bigarray))",
