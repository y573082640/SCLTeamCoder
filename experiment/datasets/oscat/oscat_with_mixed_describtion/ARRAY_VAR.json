    "description": "ARRAY_VAR calculates the variance of an arbitrary array of\nREAL. When called a pointer to the array and its size in bytes is passed to\nthe function. Under CoDeSys the call reads: ARRAY_VAR(ADR(Array), SI￾ZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of the array to be manipulated.\nADR() is a standard function, which identifes the pointer to the array and\nSIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines the size of the array. In\norder to determine the maximum, the array referenced by the pointer is\nscanned directly in memory. The function ARRAY_VAR does not change the\ncontent of the array. \nThis type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.",
