    "description": "ARRAY_SDV calculates the standard deviation (Standard De￾viation) value of an arbitrary array of REAL. When called a pointer to the\narray and its size in bytes is passed to the function. Under CoDeSys the\ncall reads: ARRAY_SDV(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where array is the\nname of the array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function, which\nidentifes the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function,\nwhich determines the size of the array. In order to determine the maxi￾mum, the array referenced by the pointer is scanned directly in memory.\nThe function ARRAY_SDV does not change the contents of the array. \nThis type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.",
