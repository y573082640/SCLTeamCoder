    "description": "_ARRAY_INIT initializes an arbitrary array of REAL with an in￾itial value. When called, a pointer to the array and its size in bytes is\ntransferred to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads:\n_ARRAY_INIT(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array), INIT), where array is the name of\nthe array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which identifes\nthe pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which deter￾mines the size of the array. The function only returns TRUE. The array spe￾cifed by the pointer is manipulated directly in memory. \nThis type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.",
