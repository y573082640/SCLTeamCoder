The generator\ngenerates a fxed frequency F with a duty cycle (TON / TOFF) which can be\nmodulated (adjusted) by the input DC. A value of 0.5 at the input DC geï¿¾nerates a duty cycle of 50%. \nThe following image shows an output signal with a duty - cycle 2 / 1, which\ncorresponds to a DC (ratio) of 0.67.",
