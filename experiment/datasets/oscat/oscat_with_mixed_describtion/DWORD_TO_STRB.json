The output string consists of the characters '0\n'and '1'. The least signifcant bit is left in the string. DWORD_TO_STRB can\nhandle input formats, Byte, Word and DWORD types. The output is inde￾pendent of the input type is always a STRING of 32 characters. If a shorter\nstring is needed, it can be cut with the standard function RIGHT() accor-\ndingly. The call RIGHT(DWORD_TO_STRB(X),8) results to a string of 8 cha￾racters to the contents of the lower bytes of X.",
