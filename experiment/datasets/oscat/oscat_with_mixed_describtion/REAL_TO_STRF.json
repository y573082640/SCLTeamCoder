At the conversion IN is rounded to N digits after the decimal\npoint and then converted into a String to the format XXX.NNN. When N =\n0, the REAL number is rounded to 0 digits after the decimal point and the\nresult is passed as an integer without a point and decimal places. If the\nnumber IN is less than, as with N decimal places can be captured, a zero is\npassed. The decimal places are always flled up to N digits with zeros. The\nmaximum string length is 20 digits. The D input determines which characï¿¾ter represents the decimal point.",
