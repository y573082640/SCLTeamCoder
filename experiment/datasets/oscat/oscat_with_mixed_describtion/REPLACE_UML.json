If a word is all upper case and is an umlaut is mentioned,\nthis is replaced by a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter, in the\ncase of a ß which has no capitals there will always be replaced with two\nsmall letters. If the function REPLACE_UML is used on a uppercase word,\nthen it must be ensured using the function UPPERCASE() that all capital\nletters that the lower case are again converted to uppercase.\nÄ > Ae, Ö > Oe, Ü > Ue, ä > ae, ö > oe, ü > oe, ß > ss.",
