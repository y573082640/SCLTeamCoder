The output string consists of the characters '0 'and '1'. The least si￾gnifcant bit is right in the STRING. If a STRING is required with less than 8\ncharacters, it can be truncated with the standard function RIGHT () accor￾dingly. The call RIGHT(BYTE_TO_STRB (X),4) results in a STRING with four\ncharacters that correspond to the content of the lowest 4 bits of X.",
