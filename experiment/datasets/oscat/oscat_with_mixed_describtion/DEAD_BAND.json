    "description": "DEAD_BAND is a linear transfer function with dead zone. The function moï¿¾ves the positive part of the curve to -L and the negative part of the curve\nby +L. DEAD_BAND is used to flter a quantization noise and other noise\ncomponents from a signal. DEAD_BAND, for example, is used in control\nsystems in order to prevent that the controller permanently switches in\nsmall increments, while the actuator is overstressed and worn out.\nDEAD_BAND = X - SGN(X)*L if ABS(X)> L if ABS(X) > L \nDEAD_BAND = 0 if ABS(X) <= L",
