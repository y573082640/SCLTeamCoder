For\nexample, also be February, 30th will be set, which, of course results the\n1st March or in a leap year, the March, 2nd. SET_DATE can therefore also\nbe used to generate any day of the year. This can be a quite practicable\napplication. In this case, the monthly amount may also be 0. An invalid\nmonth always gives a date in relation to January. An invalid month (month\n< 1 or month > 12) is always interpreted as January.",
