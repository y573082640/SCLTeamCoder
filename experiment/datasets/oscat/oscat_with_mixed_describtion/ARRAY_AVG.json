    "description": "ARRAY_AVG calculates the median value of an arbitrary ar￾ray ofREAL. When called, a pointer to the array and its size in bytes is pas￾sed to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads:\nARRAY_AVG(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of the\narray to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which identifes the\npointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines\nthe size of the array. In order to determine the maximum, the array refe￾renced by the pointer is scanned directly in memory. The function\nARRAY_AVG does not change the content of the array. \nThis type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.",
