    "description": "STAIR follows the input signal X with a step function. The \nheight of the steps is given by D. If X = 0, then the output directly follows \nthe input signal. STAIR is not suitable for fltering of input signals, because \nif the input fuctuates by a step , the output switches between two \nadjacent values back and forth. For this purpose we recommend the use of \nStair2 that works with a Hysteresis and avoids unstable conditions.\nThe following example illustrates the operation of STAIR:",
