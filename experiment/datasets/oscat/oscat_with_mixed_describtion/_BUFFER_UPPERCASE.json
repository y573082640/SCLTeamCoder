When called, a pointer to\nthe array and its size in bytes is passed to the function. Under CoDeSys\nthe call reads: _BUFFER_INIT(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array), INIT), where array\nis the name of the array to be manipulated. ADR is a standard function,\nwhich identifes the Pointer the array and SIZEOF is a standard function,\nwhich determines the size of the array. The function only returns TRUE. By\nthe Pointer given array is manipulated directly in memory. \nThis type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional meï¿¾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.",
