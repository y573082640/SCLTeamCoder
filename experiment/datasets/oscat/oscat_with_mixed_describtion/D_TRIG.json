    "description": "D_TRIG triggers on any change in the DWORD-input IN. If the input \nvalue has changed, the output Q for a PLC cycle is set to TRUE and the \noutput X indicates how much has changed in the IN input. The input and \noutput are of type DWORD. The input can also process WORD and BYTE \ntypes. With output X it should be noted that DWORD is unsigned and \ntherefore a change of -1 at the input is not -1, but the number 2^32-2 at \nthe output. With the standard function DWORD_TO_INT the output X can \nbe converted to an integer, which displays also negative changes correctly.\nThe following example shows the application of D_TRIG when the input\nchanges value from 5 to 2:",
