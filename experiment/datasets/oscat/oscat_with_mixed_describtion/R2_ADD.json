    "description": "_BUFFER_INIT initializes any array of Byte with value INIT.\nWhen called, a pointer to the array and its size in bytes is passed to the\nfunction. Under CoDeSys the call reads: _BUFFER_INIT(ADR(Array), SI￾ZEOF(Array), INIT), where array is the name of the array to be manipula￾ted. ADR() is a standard function which identifes the pointer to the array\nand SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines the size of the ar￾ray. The function only returns TRUE. The array specifed by the pointer is\nmanipulated directly in memory. \nThis type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.",
