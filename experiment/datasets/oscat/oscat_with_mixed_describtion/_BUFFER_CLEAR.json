When cal￾led, a pointer to the array and its size in bytes is passed to the function.\nUnder CoDeSys is the call: _BUFFER_CLEAR(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)),\nwhere array is the name of the array to be manipulated. ADR() is a stan￾dard function which identifes the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a\nstandard function, which determines the size of the array. The function\nonly returns TRUE. The array specifed by the pointer is manipulated di￾rectly in memory. \nThis type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.",
