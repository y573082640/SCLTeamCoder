    "description": "BAR_GRAPH is a level Detector, which activates depending on the input\nvalue an output. The threshold for the LOW and HIGH Outputs can be set\nby the setup variables TRIGGER_LOW and TRIGGER_HIGH. LOW is TRUE if\nX is less than TRIGGER_LOW and HIGH is true if X is greater or equal than\nTRIGGER_HIGH. If the setup variables ALARM_LOW and / or ALARM_HIGH\nset to TRUE, the output ALARM set to TRUE if the value will be lower than\nTRIGGER_LOW or exceed of TRIGGER_HIGH , and the output LOW or HIGH\nand ALARM remains TRUE until the input RST is TRUE and the alarm is re￾seted. The outputs Q1 to Q6 divide the area between between\nTRIGGER_LOW and TRIGGER_HIGH in seven equal areas. If the setup varia￾ble LOG_SCALE is set, the area between TRIGGER_LOW and\nTRIGGER_HIGH is divided logarithmically. \nThe output Status is an ESR compliant output and forwards states and\nalarms to ESR components.\nStatus\n110 Input is between Trigger_Low and Trigger_High.\n111 Input lower than Trigger_Low , Output LOW is TRUE\n112 Input higher than Trigger_High , Output HIGH is TRUE.\n1 Input lower than Trigger_low and Alarm_Lowis TRUE\n2 Input higher than Trigger_high and Alarm_High is TRUE\nThe following example shows a signal characteristic of n Bar_Graph:",
