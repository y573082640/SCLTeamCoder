If the result from the addition of X and D\nis greater than M, then it starts again at 0. The feature is especially useful\nwhen addressing arrays and bufers. Even the positioning of absolute enï¿¾coders it can be used. INC can be used to decrementieren with a negative\nD, while INC will ensure that the result is not below zero. If subtract 1 from\nzero INC starts again at M.\nINC: = X + D, because D can take the maximum value M.\nIf INC > M so INC starts again at 0.\nIf INC < 0 so INC starts again at M",
