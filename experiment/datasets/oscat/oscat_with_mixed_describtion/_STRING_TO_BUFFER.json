When called, a pointer to the array\nand its size in bytes is passed to the function. Under CoDeSys the call\nreads: _STRING_TO_BUFFER(STR, POS, ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where\narray is the name of the array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard\nfunction which identifes the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a stan￾dard function, which determines the size of the array. The function returns\nthe string copied from the bufer as STRING. The array specifed by the\npointer is manipulated directly in memory. \nThis type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.",
