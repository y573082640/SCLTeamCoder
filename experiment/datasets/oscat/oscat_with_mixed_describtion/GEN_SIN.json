    "description": "GEN_SIN is a sine wave generator with programmable period, adjustable\namplitude and signal ofset. A special feature is a adjustable delay so that\nwith multiple generators overlapping signals can be generated. A Binary\nOutput Q passes a logical signal, which is generated phase equal to the\nsine signal. The input DL is a delay for the output signal. The Delay is speï¿¾cifed with DL * PT. A DL of 0.5 delays the signal by half a period. \nThe following example shows GEN_SIN with a trace recording of the sine\nsignal and the binary output Q.\nThe above example generates a sine wave with 0.1 Hz (PT = 10 s) and a\nlower peak value of 0 and upper peak value of 10.",
