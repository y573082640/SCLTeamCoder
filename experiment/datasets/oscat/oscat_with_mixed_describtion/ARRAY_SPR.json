    "description": "ARRAY_SPR determines the dispersion of an arbitrary array of\nREAL. The dispersion is the maximum value in the array minus the mini￾mum value of the array. When called, a Pointer to the array and its size in\nbytes is transferred to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads:\nARRAY_SPR(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of the ar￾ray to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which identifes the\npointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines\nthe size of the array. In order to determine the maximum, the array refe￾renced by the pointer is scanned directly in memory. The function\nARRAY_SPR does not change the content of the array. \nThis type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.",
