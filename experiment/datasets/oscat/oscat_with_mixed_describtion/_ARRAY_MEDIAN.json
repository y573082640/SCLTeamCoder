    "description": "_ARRAY_MEDIAN calculates the median value of an arbitrary\narray of REAL. When called a pointer to the array and its size in bytes is\npassed to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads:\n_ARRAY_MEDIAN(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of\nthe array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function, which identifes\nthe pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which deter￾mines the size of the array. In order to determine the median value the ar￾ray referenced by the pointer is sorted in the memory and remains after\nfunction end sorted. The function _ARRAY_MEDIAN thus changes the con￾tents of the array. \nThis type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.\nIf an array is processed, which should not be changed, so it has to be co￾pied to a temporary array before handing over the Pointer and calling the\nfunction.",
