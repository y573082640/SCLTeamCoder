At the input DEG the direction in degrees is available (0 = North, 90\n= East, 180 = South and 270 = West ). The output represents the directi￾on as String NNE. With the input N the maximum length of the direction in￾dication is limited. When N = 1, only in the 4 cardinal directions N, E, S, W\ndissolved. If N = 2 between each another direction is inserted: NE, SE, SW,\nNW. At N = 3 are also directions as NNO ... are dissolved, with N = 3 a to￾tal of 16 directions are evaluated. The input L allows the switching of the\nlanguages defned in the language setup. 0L = 0 means Default Langua￾ge, a number > 0 is one of the predefned languages. more info about the\npre-defned data types can be found at CONSTANTS_LANGUAGE.",
