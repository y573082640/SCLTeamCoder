    "description": "FT_AVG calculates a moving average over each of\nthe last N values. By the input RST, the stored values can be deleted. N is\ndefned from 0 .. 32. N = 0 means that the output signal = input signal. N\n= 5 is the average over the last 5 values. The average is calculated over a\nmaximum of 32 values. With input E can be control when the input is read.\nThis allows a simple way to connect a sample and a hold module, such as\nSH_1 with FT_AVG can be linked. The frst call to FT_AVG the bufer load\nthe input signal to avoid that a Ramp-up takes place. \nThe following example reads SH_1 once a second the input value Signal_In\nand passes these values once per second to FT_AVG, which then forms out\nof the last 8 values the mean value.",
