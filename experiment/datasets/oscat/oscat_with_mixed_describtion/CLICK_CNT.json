During\nthe course of Timers the module counts the falling edges of IN and review￾es after the expiry of the time TC whether N pulses are within the time TC.\nJust when exactly N pluses within TC will happen, the output Q is set for a\nPLC cycle to TRUE. The module decodes also N = 0, which corresponds to\na rising edge but not falling edge within TC.",
