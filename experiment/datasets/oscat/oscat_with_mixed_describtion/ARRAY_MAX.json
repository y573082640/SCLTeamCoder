ADR() is a standard function which identifes the\npointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines\nthe size of the array. In order to determine the maximum, the array refe￾renced by the pointer is scanned directly in memory. The function\nARRAY_MAX does not change the content of the array. \nThis type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.",
