    "description": "RES_NTC calculated the resistance of an NTC resistance sensor from the\ninput values T (temperature in °C) and RN (resistance at 25°C). The input\nvalue B is a constant value which must be read in the data sheets of that\nsensor. Typical values are at NTC sensors 2000 - 4000 Kelvin.\nThe calculation is done using the formula:\nThe formula provides a sufcient accuracy for small temperature ranges,\neg 0-100°C. For wide temperature ranges the formula according to Stein￾hart is more suitable.",
