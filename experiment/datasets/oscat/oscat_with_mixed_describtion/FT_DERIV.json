    "description": "FT_DERIV is a D-link, or LZI-transfer element, which has a diferentiating\ntransfer behavior. At the output of FT_DERIV the derivative is over time T\nin seconds. When the input signal increases in one second from 3 to 4\nthen the output 1 * K (K *  X /  T = 1 * (4-3) / 1 = 1\nIn other words, the derivative of the input signal, the instantaneous slope\nof the input signal. With the input RUN the FT_DERIV can be enabled or di￾sabled. FT_DERIV works internally in microseconds and fulfll also the re￾quirements of very fast PLC controller with cycle times under a millise￾cond.\nStructure diagram:",
