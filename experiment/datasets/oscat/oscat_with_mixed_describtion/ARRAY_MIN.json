    "description": "ARRAY_MIN calculates the minimum value of any array of\nREAL. When called the function passed a Pointer to the array and its size\nin bytes. Under CoDeSys the call reads: ARRAY_MIN(ADR(Array),\nSIZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of the array to be manipulated.\nADR() is a standard function, which identifes the pointer to the array and\nSIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines the size of the array. In\norder to determine the maximum, the array referenced by the pointer is\nscanned directly in memory. The function ARRAY _ MIN does not change\nthe contents of the array. \nThis type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional meï¿¾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.",
