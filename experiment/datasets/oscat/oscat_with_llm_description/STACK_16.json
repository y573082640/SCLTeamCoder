  "description": "This function block implements a stack data structure with a fixed capacity of 16 elements. It supports reading from and writing to the stack, along with reset functionality. The stack operates in a first-in-last-out (FILO) manner, and the block provides status indicators for the emptiness and fullness of the stack.",
