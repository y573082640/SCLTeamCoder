  "description": "This function calculates a value based on the input X, which is a real number. The behavior of the function is determined by the value of X and follows specific conditional rules. If X is zero, the output is zero. If X is greater than 15.0, the output is a predefined mathematical constant (math.PI05). If X is less than -15.0, the output is the negative of that constant. For values of X between -15.0 and 15.0, the output is calculated using the ATAN and EXP functions.",
