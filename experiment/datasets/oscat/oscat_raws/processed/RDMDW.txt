RDMDW charges pseudo - random number with 32 bits in length in the for￾mat DWORD. This is the PLC's internal timer that is read and is transferred
into a pseudo random number. Since RDMDW as a function and was not
written as a function module, it can not save data between 2 calls and
should therefore be used with caution. If RDMDW called only once per cy￾cle, it produces reasonable good results. But when it is repeatedly called
within a cycle, it delivers the same number, most likely because of the PLC
timer is still on the same value. If the function is repeatedly used within a
cycle, so it must be passed with each call a diferent number of starts
(LAST). If it be called only once per cycle, it is sufcient to call RDMDW(0).
As a starting number for each call, the last number accounted by RDMDW
be used. That result from RDMDW is a random 32-bit wide bit pattern.
