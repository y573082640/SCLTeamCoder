Type Function: REAL
Input X: REAL (input)
Output REAL (output value)
COTH calculates the hyperbolic cotangent by the following formula:
For input values larger than 20 or less than -20 COTH provides the approï¿¾ximate value +1 or -1 corresponding to an accuracy better than 8 digits
and is thus below the resolution of type REAL.
