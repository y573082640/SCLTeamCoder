RES_NTC calculated the resistance of an NTC resistance sensor from the
input values T (temperature in °C) and RN (resistance at 25°C). The input
value B is a constant value which must be read in the data sheets of that
sensor. Typical values are at NTC sensors 2000 - 4000 Kelvin.
The calculation is done using the formula:
The formula provides a sufcient accuracy for small temperature ranges,
eg 0-100°C. For wide temperature ranges the formula according to Stein￾hart is more suitable.
