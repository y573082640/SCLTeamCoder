Type Function: REAL
Input PT: Pointer (pointer to the array)
SIZE: UINT (size of the array)
Output REAL (mean value of the array)
The function _ARRAY_AVG calculates the median value of an arbitrary ar￾ray ofREAL. When called, a pointer to the array and its size in bytes is pas￾sed to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads:
ARRAY_AVG(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of the
array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which identifes the
pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines
the size of the array. In order to determine the maximum, the array refe￾renced by the pointer is scanned directly in memory. The function
ARRAY_AVG does not change the content of the array. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
Example: ARRAY_AVG(ADR(bigarray), SIZEOF (bigarray))
