DT_SIMU simulates on output DTS a date value that starts with the initial
value of START and continues with the speed SPEED. If SPEED intthe input
value not used, the device operates with the internal standard value 1.0
and the DTS output is running forward at 1 second/second. With the input
SPEED at the output DTS an arbitrarily fast or slow clock can be simulated.
The module can be used in the simulation environment to simulate an RTC
and also adjust the speed of the RTC for testing. If the input SPEED = 0,
the output DTS at each PLC cycle is further increased by a second.
