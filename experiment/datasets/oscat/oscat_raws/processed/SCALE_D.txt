SCALE_D scales an input value DWORD and calculates an output value in
REAL. The input value X is limited here to I_LO and I_HI. SCALE_D (IN, 0,
8191, 0, 100) scales an input with 14 bit resolution to the output 0..100.
SCALE_D can also be negative and have a negative slope work at output
values, and the values I_LO and I_HI must always be specifed that ILO <
I_HI is.
