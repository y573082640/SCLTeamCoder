SUN_TIME is a astro timer. It calculates sunrise and 
sunset for any day, defned by the input UTC. In addition to sunrise and 
sunset, the time of the solar azimuth (daily peak in the south) and the 
solar angle above the horizon in the azimuth is calculated. This SUN_TIME 
will work regardless of the site all the time is calculated in UTC (Universal 
Time) and can again be converted to local time as needed. In addition, to 
the times of sunrise and sunset, the module also calculates the angle of 
the sun above the horizon SUN_DECLINATION. SUN_TIME uses a complex 
algorithm to minimize the loading of a PLC as low as possible, the values 
should be calculated with SUN_TIME only once per day. SUN_TIME is used 
for the control of blinds, in order to pull up just before sunrise and enjoy in 
the bedroom the twilight. Other applications are include controlling 
irrigation in horticulture to using the sunrise and sunset or even for 
tracking solar panels. Further calculations of Sun's position is provided by 
the module SUN_POS. SUN_TIME is only in latitudes between 65°S and 
65°North is available. The output MIDDAY passes, at what time the sun is 
the south and SUN_DECLINATION stating the angle above the horizon in 
degrees.
