Type Function
Input X: REAL (input)
LOW : REAL (lower range limit) 
HIGH: REAL (upper limit)
Output WORD (output value)
RANGE_TO_WORD converts a REAL value to a WORD value. An input value
of X corresponds to the value of LOW is converted it into an output value
of 0 and an input value X that corresponds to HIGH is converted to an outï¿¾put value of 65535. The X input is limited to the range from LOW to HIGH,
an overfow of the output WORD therefore can not happen.
