RANGE_TO_BYTE converts a real value in a BYTE value. An input value of X
corresponds to the value of LOW is converted it into an output value of 0
and an input value X of the input value corresponds to HIGH is converted
into an output value of 255. The input X is limited to the range from LOW
to HIGH, an overfow of the output BYTE can therefore not happen.
