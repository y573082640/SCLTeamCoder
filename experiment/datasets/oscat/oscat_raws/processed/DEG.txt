Type Function: REAL
Input Rad: REAL (angle in radians)
Output REAL (angle in degrees)
The function converts an angle value from radians to degrees. This takes
into account the input may be not larger than 2.. If RAD is greater than
2, the equivalent to 2 is deducted until the input RAD is between 0 and
2. 
DEG(π) = 180 Grad, DEG(3π) = 180 Grad
DEG(0) = 0 Grad, DEG(2π) = 0 Grad
