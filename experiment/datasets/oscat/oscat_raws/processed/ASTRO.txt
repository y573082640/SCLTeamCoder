Type Function module
Input M: REAL (distance in meter)
AE: REAL (distance in astronomical units)
PC: REAL (distance in parsecs)
LJ: REAL (distance in light years)
Output YM: REAL (distance in meters)
YAE: REAL (distance in astronomical units)
YPC: REAL (distance in parsecs)
YLJ: REAL (distance in light years)
The module ASTRO converts various distance units commonly used in 
astronomy. Normally, only the input to be converted is occupied and the 
remaining inputs remain free. However, if several inputs loaded with 
values, the values of all inputs are converted accordingly and then 
summed.
1 AE = 149,597870 * 109 m
1 PC = 206265 AE
1 LJ = 9,460530 * 1015 m = 63240 AE = 0,30659 PC
