Type Function : INT
Input PT: POINTER (address of the Bufer) 
SIZE: UINT (size of the bufer)
STR: STRING (search string)
POS: INT (from the position being sought)
IGN: BOOL (Search is case-sensitive)
Output INT (position of the string was found)
The function BUFFER _ SEARCH search any array of Bytes on the contents
of a string and reports the position of the frst character of the string in the
array when a matching is found. The Bufer is searched from any position
POS. The frst element in the array is at position number 0. When called, a
Pointer to the array and its size in bytes is passed to the function. Under
CoDeSys the call reads: BUFFER_SEARCH (ADR (Array), SIZEOF (ARRAY),
STR, POS, IGN), where ARRAY is the name of the array. ADR() is a standard
function which identifes the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a stan￾dard function, which determines the size of the array. The function returns
the string copied from the bufer as STRING. This type of processing arrays
is very efcient because no additional memory is required and no surren￾der values must be copied. If IGN = TRUE both upper- and lowercase let￾ters are found as a match, while STR must be present in uppercase letters.
If IGN = FALSE case sensitive is searched. 
Example: BUFFER_SEARCH(ADR(aArray), SIZEOF(Array), 'FIND', 0, TRUE) 
Locates 'FIND', 'Find', 'fnd' .... in the array.
Example: BUFFER_SEARCH(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(ARRAY), 'FIND', 0, FALSE) 
Only fnds 'FIND' in the array.
