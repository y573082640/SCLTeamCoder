BUFFER_SEARCH (ADR (Array), SIZEOF (ARRAY),
STR, POS, IGN), where ARRAY is the name of the array. ADR() is a standard
function which identifes the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a stan￾dard function, which determines the size of the array. The function returns
the string copied from the bufer as STRING. This type of processing arrays
is very efcient because no additional memory is required and no surren￾der values must be copied. If IGN = TRUE both upper- and lowercase let￾ters are found as a match, while STR must be present in uppercase letters.
If IGN = FALSE case sensitive is searched.
