Type Function module
Input UTC: DATE_TIME (Universal Time)
DST_ENABLE: BOOL(TRUE allows DST)
TIME_ZONE_OFFSET: INT(time diference to UTC in minutes)
Output DT: DATE_TIME (local time)
The function module UTC_TO_LTIME calculates from the universal time at
input UTC the local time (LOCAL_DT), with automatic daylight saving time
if DST_ENABLE is set to True. If DST_ENABLE is FALSE, the local time is cal￾culated without daylight saving.
This function module requires UTC at the input, which is normally provided
by the PLC and can be read by a routine of the manufacturer. 
The following example an application for a WAGO 750-841 CPU is shown.
The reading of the internal clock is done by the manufacturer SYSRTCGET￾TIME routine. The PLC clock must be in this case set to UTC.
