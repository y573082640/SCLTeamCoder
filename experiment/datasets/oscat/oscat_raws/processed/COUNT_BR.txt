COUNT_BR is a byte count from 0 to MX and starts again at 0. The counter
can, using two edge-triggered inputs UP and DN, both forward and back￾ward counting. when reaching a fnal value 0 or MX it counts again at 0 or
MX. The STEP input sets the increment value of the counter. With a TRUE
at input SET the counter is set to present value at the IN input. A reset in￾put RST resets the counter at any time to 0.
SET IN UP DN STEP RST CNT
Reset - - - - - 1 0
Set 1 N - - - 0 N
up 0 - ↑ 0 N 0 CNT + N
down 0 - 0 ↑ N 0 CNT - N
If the independent inputs UP and DN with CLK and a control input UP/DN
should be replaced, id can be done using two AND gates at the inputs:
COUNT_BR may work with individual step width at UP or Down command,
it is important to note that the counter behaves as if it internally counts
the number of STEP steps forward or backward.
