Type Function: REAL
Input SET_POINT: REAL (default)
ACTUAL: REAL (process value)
NOISE: REAL (threshold)
Output REAL (Process deviation) 
CTRL_IN calculates the process deviation (SET_POINT _ ACTUAL) and pasï¿¾ses them at the output. If the diference is less than the value at the input
NOISE of the output remains at 0. CTRL_IN can be used to build own rule
modules.
