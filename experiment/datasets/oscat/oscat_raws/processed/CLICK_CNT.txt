CLICK_CNT determines the number of pulses within the unit time TC. at in￾put IN. A rising edge at IN will start an internal timer with time TC. During
the course of Timers the module counts the falling edges of IN and review￾es after the expiry of the time TC whether N pulses are within the time TC.
Just when exactly N pluses within TC will happen, the output Q is set for a
PLC cycle to TRUE. The module decodes also N = 0, which corresponds to
a rising edge but not falling edge within TC.
