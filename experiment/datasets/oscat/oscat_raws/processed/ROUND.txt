ROUND rounds the input value IN to N digits. Follows the last
digit a digit greater than 5 the last digit is rounded up. ROUND internally
uses the standard function TRUNC() which converts the input value to an
INTEGER type DINT. This may come as an overfow because DINT can store
in maximum +/-2.14*10^9. The range of ROUND is therefore limited to +/-
2.14 * 10^9.
