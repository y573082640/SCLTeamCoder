TP_X is a multiple triggerable pulse generator. In contrast to the standard
module TP this template can be triggered multiple times and thus the out￾put pulse can be extended. The output Q remains after the last trigger
event (rising edge of IN) at ON, for the period of PT. While Q is true, by a
further edge at the IN the Timer can be triggered again and the output
pulse can be extended. In contrast to TOF, at TP_X the time PT is measu￾red as of the last rising edge, regardless of how long IN remains at TRUE.
This means that the output Q, after the time PT, is measured from the last
rising edge of IN moves to FALSE, even when the input IN is TRUE.
