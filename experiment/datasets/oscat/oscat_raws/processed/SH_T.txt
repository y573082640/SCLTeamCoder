Type Function module
Input IN: REAL (input signal)
E: BOOL ( enable Signal) 
Output OUT_MAX: REAL (upper output limit)
SH_T is a transparent Sample and Hold module. The input signal is proviï¿¾ded at the output, as long as E is TRUE. With a falling edge of E, the value

switched back to OUT. 
The following example illustrates the operation of SH_T
