Type Function module
Input F: REAL (output frequency)
PW:TIME (pulse duration high ) 
Output Q: BOOL (output)
PWM_PW is a pulse width modulated frequency generator. The generator
generates a fxed frequency F with a duty cycle (TON / TOFF) which can
bemodulated (set) by the input PW. The input passes the time before the
signal remains TRUE.
