DEAD_BAND_A is a self adapting linear transfer function with dead zone.
The function moves the positive part of the curve to -L and the negative
part of the curve by +L. DEAD_BAND_A is used to flter the noise com￾ponents at the origin of a signal. DEAD_BAND_A, for example, used in con￾trol systems in order to prevent that the controller permanently switches
in small increments, while the actuator is overstressed and worn out.
The size L is calculated by fltering the HF cpmponents of the input signal
X using a low pass with time constant T and the dead zone L calculated
from the amplitude of the HF portion. The sensitivity of the device can be
changed via the parameter KL. KL is predefned to 1 and can be unconnec￾ted. Reasonable values for KL are between 1 - 5.
L = HF_Amplitude(efective) *KL.
So that the module will remain stable even under extreme operating con￾ditions, the input LM is limited by of the maximum value of L.
DEAD_BAND = X - SGN(X)*L if ABS(X)> L if ABS(X) > L 
DEAD_BAND = 0 if ABS(X) <= L
