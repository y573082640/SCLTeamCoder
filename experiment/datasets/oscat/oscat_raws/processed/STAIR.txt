STAIR follows the input signal X with a step function. The 
height of the steps is given by D. If X = 0, then the output directly follows 
the input signal. STAIR is not suitable for fltering of input signals, because 
if the input fuctuates by a step , the output switches between two 
adjacent values back and forth. For this purpose we recommend the use of 
Stair2 that works with a Hysteresis and avoids unstable conditions.
The following example illustrates the operation of STAIR:
