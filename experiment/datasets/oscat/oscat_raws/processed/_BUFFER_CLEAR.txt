Type Function : BOOL
Input PT: POINTER TO BYTE (address of the Bufer ) 
SIZE: UINT (size of the bufer)
Output BOOL (Returns TRUE)
The function _BUFFER_CLEAR initialize any array of Byte with 0. When cal￾led, a pointer to the array and its size in bytes is passed to the function.
Under CoDeSys is the call: _BUFFER_CLEAR(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)),
where array is the name of the array to be manipulated. ADR() is a stan￾dard function which identifes the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a
standard function, which determines the size of the array. The function
only returns TRUE. The array specifed by the pointer is manipulated di￾rectly in memory. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
Example: _ARRAY_CLEAR(ADRs(bigarray), SIZEOF(bigarray))
initialized bigarray with 0.
