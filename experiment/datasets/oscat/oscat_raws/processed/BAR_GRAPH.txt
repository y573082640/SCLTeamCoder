BAR_GRAPH is a level Detector, which activates depending on the input
value an output. The threshold for the LOW and HIGH Outputs can be set
by the setup variables TRIGGER_LOW and TRIGGER_HIGH. LOW is TRUE if
X is less than TRIGGER_LOW and HIGH is true if X is greater or equal than
TRIGGER_HIGH. If the setup variables ALARM_LOW and / or ALARM_HIGH
set to TRUE, the output ALARM set to TRUE if the value will be lower than
TRIGGER_LOW or exceed of TRIGGER_HIGH , and the output LOW or HIGH
and ALARM remains TRUE until the input RST is TRUE and the alarm is re￾seted. The outputs Q1 to Q6 divide the area between between
TRIGGER_LOW and TRIGGER_HIGH in seven equal areas. If the setup varia￾ble LOG_SCALE is set, the area between TRIGGER_LOW and
TRIGGER_HIGH is divided logarithmically. 
The output Status is an ESR compliant output and forwards states and
alarms to ESR components.
Status
110 Input is between Trigger_Low and Trigger_High.
111 Input lower than Trigger_Low , Output LOW is TRUE
112 Input higher than Trigger_High , Output HIGH is TRUE.
1 Input lower than Trigger_low and Alarm_Lowis TRUE
2 Input higher than Trigger_high and Alarm_High is TRUE
