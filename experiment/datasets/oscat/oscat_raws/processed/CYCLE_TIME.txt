CYCLE_TIME monitors the cycle time of a PLC and provides the user with a
range of information about cycle times and run times. The total number of
cycles is also measured. Hereby, the user can, for example ensure that a
function is called every 100 cycles. Control modules can report errors if
the cycle time is too long and therefore the control parameters can not be
guaranteed.
