BYTE_TO_STRB convert a byte into a fxed-length STRING. The output
string is exactly 8 characters long and is the bitwise notation of the value
of IN. The output string consists of the characters '0 'and '1'. The least si￾gnifcant bit is right in the STRING. If a STRING is required with less than 8
characters, it can be truncated with the standard function RIGHT () accor￾dingly. The call RIGHT(BYTE_TO_STRB (X),4) results in a STRING with four
characters that correspond to the content of the lowest 4 bits of X.
