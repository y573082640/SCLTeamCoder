CTRL_PI is a PI controller with dynamic anti-wind-up and manual control in￾put. The PI controller operates according to the formula:
Y = KP * DIFF + KI * INTEG(DIFF) + OFFSET
where DIFF = SET_POINT - ACTUAL
In manual mode (manual = TRUE) is: Y = MANUAL_IN+ OFFSET
ACT is the measured value for the controlled system and set the setpoint
for the controller. The input values of LH and LL limit Output value Y. With
RST the internal integrator may be set to 0 any time. The output LIM si￾gnals that the controller has reached the limit of LL or LH. The PI controller
is free running and uses the trapezoidal rule to calculate the integrator for
the highest accuracy and optimal speed. The Default Values of the input
parameters are predefned as follows: KP = 1, KI = 1, LIMIT_L = -1000 and
LIMIT_H = +1000. With the input SUP a noise reduction is set, the value on
input SUP determines at which control diference the controller turns on.
With SUP is avoided that the output of the controller varies continously.
The value at the input SUP should be in dimension that it suppresses the
noise of the controlled system and the sensors. If the input to SUP is set to
0.1, the controller is only at deviations greater than 0.1 active. At the out￾put DIFF the measured and through a Noise Filter (DEAD_BAND) fltered
control deviation is available. DIFF is normally not required in a controlled
system but can be used to infuence the control parameters. The input
OFS is added as the last value to output, and is used to compensate main￾ly of noise, whose efect can be estimated on the loop. 
The controller works with a dynamic air- Up that prevents that the integra￾tor, when reaching a output limit and further deviation, continues to run
unlimited and afects the properties usually negative. In the introduction
chapter of the control technology, more details can be found on anti-wind￾up.
