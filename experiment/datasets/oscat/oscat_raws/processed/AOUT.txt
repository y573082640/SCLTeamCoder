AOUT is confgured by setup parameters and calculates the input
values (IN) to accordingly, so that after the module AOUT is a digital value
available at the output of the D/A converter generates a value that is the
REAL value IN matches. Furthermore, the module can insert a Sign- Bit
anywhere if the D/A converter need a Sign- Bit. By double-clicking on the
module, several setup variables can be defned. Bits defne how many Bits
the D/A converter can handle. For a 12 bit converter, this value is 12. Then
only the bits 0 - 11 are scored. Sign defnes whether a sign bit is needed
and where to place in the source DWORD. Sign = 255 means that no sign
bit is needed, and 15 means Bit 15 in the DWORD contains the sign. LOW
and HIGH defne the smallest and highest input value. If a Sign-Bit is defï¿¾ned ( SIGN< 255), then LOW and HIGH must be positive. Without Sign-Bit
they can be either positive or negative.
