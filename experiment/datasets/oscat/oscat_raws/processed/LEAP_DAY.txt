LEAP_DAY function checks if the input date is a leap or a 29th Februaï¿¾ry. The test is valid for the time window from 1970 to 2099. In the year
2100 a leap year indicated although this is not one. However, since the
range of dates according to IEC61131-3 extends only to the year 2106 this
correction will be omitted.
