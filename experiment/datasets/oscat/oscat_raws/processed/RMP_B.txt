Type Function module
Input SET: BOOL (set input)
PT: TIME (duration of a ramp 0..255)
E: BOOL (enable input)
UP: BOOL (direction UP = TRUE means Up)
RST: BOOL (Reset input)
Output I/O
BUSY: BOOL (TRUE, when ramp is running)
HIGH: BOOL (maximum output value is reached)
LOW: BOOL (Minimum output value is reached)
RMP_B is a ramp generator with 8 bits (1 byte) resolution. The ramp of
0..255 is divided into a maximum of 255 steps and go through, in a time
of PT once complete. An enable signal E switches the ramp generator on
or of. An asynchronous reset sets each time the output to 0, and a pulse
at the SET input sets the output to 255. With a UD input, the direction
OPEN (UD = TRUE) or down (UD = FALSE) is set. The output of BUSY =
TRUE indicates that a ramp is active. BUSY = FALSE means the output is
stable. The outputs HIGH and LOW are TRUE, if the output OUT reaches
the lower or upper limit (0 and 255).
At setting of PT has to be noted, that a PLC with 5ms cycle time needs
256*5 = 1275 milliseconds for a ramp. If the time PT is made shorter than
the cycle time multiplied by 256, the edge is translated in correspondingly
larger steps. The ramp is constructed in this case with less than 256 steps
per cycle. PT may be T#0s, then the output switched between minimum
and maximum value back and forth.
The following example shows an application of RMP_B. The outputs HIGH
and LOW triggers both NTSC (X4, X5) 1 second delayed, and switch with
the RS Flip Flop (X6) the UP input of the Ramps generators in order. The
result is a ramp of 5 seconds, followed by an break of 1 second and then
the reverse gradient of 5 seconds and then a break of 1 second. In the
Trace the history of the signals can be seen.
