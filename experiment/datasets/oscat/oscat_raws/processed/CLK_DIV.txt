CLK_DIV is a divider module and devides the input si￾gnal CLK into 8 levels each divided by 2, so that at the output Q0 is half
the frequency of the input CLK with 50% duty cycle available. The output
Q1 is the halved frequency of Q0 available and so on, until at Q7 the input
frequency is divided by 256. A reset input RST sets asynchronous all out￾puts to FALSE. CLK is allowed to make only one cycle to TRUE, if CLK does
not this, CLK musst provided over TP_R.
 The following example is a test circuit with a start signal via ENI / ENO
realized functionality. Figure 2 shows a corresponding trace recording of
the circuit:
