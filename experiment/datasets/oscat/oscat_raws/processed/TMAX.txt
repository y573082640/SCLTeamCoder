TMAX limits the duration of the output pulse to the time PT. The output Q
follows the input IN, as long as the TRUE time of IN is shorter than PT. If IN
is longer than PT to TRUE, the output pulse is shortened. Whenever an
output changes by a timeout to FALSE, the output Z is set to TRUE for a
cycle.
