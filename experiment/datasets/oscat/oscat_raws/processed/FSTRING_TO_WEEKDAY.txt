FSTRING_TO_WEEKDAY decodes a weekday in the form 'MO' to an integer,
1 = MO ... 7 = Sun. For the analysis the frst two letters of the string WDAY
are evaluated, all others are ignored. If the string contains spaces they will
be removed. The days of the week can be present in both upper-or lower￾case. Since the function evaluates only the frst two characters, the week￾days may also be spelled out (Monday) format.
Mo = 1; Di, Tu = 2; We, Mi = 3; Th, Do = 4; Fr = 5; Sa = 6; So, Su = 7
As an alternative form, the weekday can be specifed as number 1..7.
LANG specifes the used language, 1 = English, 2 = German, 0 = defned
default language in the Setup.
