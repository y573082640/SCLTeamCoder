INC_DEC is a decoder for incremental encoder. Encoder (rotation encoder)
deliver two overlapping pulses, channel A and channel B. By the two chan￾nels, the direction and angle of rotation is decoded. INC_DEC detect each
edge of the encoder, so 4 times the resolution is achieved. The output DIR
shows the direction of rotation, and at the output CNT is an integer value
provided, which outputs the number of counted pulses. For a full rotation
of an encoder with 100 pulses CNT counts to 400, because each edge is
counted at both channels, so 4 times the resolution is achieved. A RST in￾put allows any time to set the counter to 0. The counter counts up when
DIR = TRUE, and down if DIR = FALSE.
