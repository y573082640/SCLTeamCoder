TEMP_PT calculates the temperature of a PT-resistance from the RES sen￾sor input values (measured resistance value) and R0 (resistance at 0°C). If
the inputs has a temperature outside the range of -200.. + 850°C, at the
output the temperature output +10000.0°C is passed.
The calculation is done using the formula:
for temperatures > 0 °C
RES_PT = R0 * (1 + A*T + B*T²)
and for temperatures below 0 ° C
RES_PT = R0 * (1 + A*T + B*T² + C*(T-100)*T³
A = 3.90802E-3; B = -5.80195E-7; C = -427350E-12
