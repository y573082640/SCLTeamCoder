CTRL_OUT adds to the CI input the value of OFFSET and returns the result
to Y if MANUAL = FALSE. If MANUAL is TRUE at output Y the input value of
MAN_IN + OFFSET is issued. Y is always limited to the boundaries defned
by LIM_L and LIM_H. If Y reaches one of the limits, then the output LIM is
TRUE. CTRL_OUT can be used to build own rule modules.
