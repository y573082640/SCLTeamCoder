_BUFFER_UPPERCASE interprets each byte in the bufer as
ASCII characters and converts it to uppercase . When called, a pointer to
the array and its size in bytes is passed to the function. Under CoDeSys
the call reads: _BUFFER_INIT(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array), INIT), where array
is the name of the array to be manipulated. ADR is a standard function,
which identifes the Pointer the array and SIZEOF is a standard function,
which determines the size of the array. The function only returns TRUE. By
the Pointer given array is manipulated directly in memory. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional meï¿¾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
