TEMP_EXT processes up to 3 remote temperature sensor and provides by
mode a selected external temperature to the heating control. It calculates
signals for heating and cooling depending on outdoor temperature, date
and time. With the input T_EXT_Setup is defned how the output value
T_EXT is determined. If T_EXT_Setup is not connected, then the default va￾lue 0. The setup values T_EXT_MIN and T_EXT_Max set the minimum and
maximum value of the external temperature inputs. If these limits are ex￾ceeded or not reached, a fault in the sensor or broken wire is assumed and
instead of measured valued the default value T_EXT_DEFAULT is used.

With the setup variables HEAT_PERIOD and COOL_PERIOD is defnes when
heating and when cooling is allowed. The decision, whether the output
HEAT or COOL gets TRUE, still depends on the setup values HEAT_START -
HEAT_STOP and COOL_START and COOL_STOP. These values can be def￾ned separately for day and night. The start of a day and night period can
be determined by the setup variables START_DAY and START_NIGHT. A va￾riable CYCLE_TIME specifes how often the outside temperature to be que￾ried.
