Type Function: DWORD
Input IN: REAL (input)
Output DWORD (output value)
REAL_TO_DW copies the bit pattern of a REAL (IN) in a DWORD. These bits
are copied without regard to their meaning. The function REAL_TO_DW is
the inverse so that the conversion of REAL_TO_DW and then DW_TO_REAL
result in the output value. The IEC standard function REAL_TO_DWORD
converts the REAL value to a fxed numerical value and is rounded at the
lowest point of the DWORD.
