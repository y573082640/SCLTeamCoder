_ARRAY_SHUFFLE(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of
the array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function, which identifes
the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which deter￾mines the size of the array. The array referenced by the Pointer is manipu￾lated directly in memory and is available directly after exit the function.
The function _ARRAY_SHUFFLE thus changes the contents of the array. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
If an array is processed, which should not be changed, so it has to be co￾pied to a temporary array before handing over the Pointer and calling the
function.
