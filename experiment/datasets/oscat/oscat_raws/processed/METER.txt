Type Function module
Input M1: REAL (consumption value of 1)
M2: REAL (consumption value of 2)
I1: BOOL (enable input 1)
I2: BOOL (enable input 2)
D: REAL (divider for the output)
RST: BOOL (Reset input)
I / O MX: REAL (consumption value)
METER is a meter, the two independent inputs (M1 and M2) are added up
over time. The counting is controlled the inputs I1 and I2. With the reset
input RST the counter can be reset at any time. The value of M1 is added
to the output value per second as long as I1 is TRUE analogous the value
of M2 is added per second to output value if I2 is TRUE. If I1 and I2 TRUE,
the value of M1 + M2 is added per seconds once to the output. The input
D Splits the output MX. Thus i.e. watt-hours can be counted instead of
watt-seconds. The module uses internally the OSCAT specifc data type
REAL2 which allows a resolution of 15 digits. This the module can capture
smallest consumption levels at the inputs of M1 and M2 with short cycle ti￾mes and add them up to high overall values at the output MX. The resolu￾tion of the block can be determined as follows. MX is defned as I/O and
must be placed on an external variable of type REAL. The external variable
can be declared as retentive and/or persistent in order to obtain the value
in case of power failure.
MX/10^15 corresponds to the minimum resolution at the inputs M1 and
M2. 
Example :
MX = 10E6 the utility meter is at 10 MWh
M1 = 0.09 Watt Current consumption is 0.1 watts
D = 3600 Output operates in Wh (Watt hours)
Cycle time is 10ms
In this example, at each cycle a value of 0.09[W] * 0.01[S]/3600 = 2.5E-
7[Wh] on the output MX is added. This represents a change in the 14 deci￾mal place of the output.
example 1 power consumption meter:
The power consumption counter of kilowatt second counts the input M1.
By the input D the output is divided by 3600, so that the output displays
kilowatt hours.
Example 2 Consumption calculation for a 2 stage burner:
In this example, the output of level 1 (M1) 85KW and stage 2 (M2) 60KW.
The inputs S1 and S1 (I1 and I2) are TRUE, if the corresponding level is
running. By the constant 3600 at D, the output is divided by 3600, so kilo￾watt hours are shown.
