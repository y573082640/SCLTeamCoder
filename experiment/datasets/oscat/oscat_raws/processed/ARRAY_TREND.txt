ARRAY_TREND calculates the trend development of all vaï¿¾lues of an arbitrary array of REAL. When called a pointer to the array and
its size in bytes is passed to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads:
ARRAY_TREND(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of the
array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function, which identifes the
pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines
the size of the array. In order to determine the trend, the array referenced
by the pointer is scanned directly in memory. The function ARRAY_TREND
does not change the content of the array. This type of processing arrays is
very efcient because no additional memory is required and no surrender
values must be copied. The trend is determined by subtract the average
of the lower half of the values of the array from the average of the values
of the upper half of the array.
