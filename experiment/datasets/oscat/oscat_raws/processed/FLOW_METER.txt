FLOW_METER determines the fow rate per unit of
time and count quantities. FLOW_METER determines the fow rate from the
input VX and E. The module supports two operating modes are determined
by the variable setup PULSE_MODE. If PULSE_MODE = TRUE is the volume
fow and the amount determined by is added at each rising edge at E, the
value of VX upon itself. If the PULSE_MODE = FALSE the input VX is inter￾preted as fow per unit time and is added up as long as E = TRUE. Using
the input RST, the internal counter can be always set to zero. X and Y are
external to be declared variables and can be declared retentive / perma￾nent to be permanent in case of power failure. The module provides the
instantaneous fow value F as the Real in accordance to the unit connec￾ted to VX. If a value at VX is applied eg. in liters / hour so is the measured
value at the output F in l / h. The output F is set at the constant intervals
UPDATE_TIME. The outputs X and Y make up the over time accumulated
measure values where X in REAL represent in the decimal point and Y in
UDINT the integer part. A count of 234.111234 is represented by 0.111234
at X and a value of 234 at Y. If for count only a REAL is used then the reso￾lution (for Real to IEEE32), is only 7-8 position . The above described me￾thod can provide more than 9 digits before the decimal point (2^32-1) and
at least 7 digits after the decimal point. Since in this case X is always
smaller than 1, Y can be used for output without decimal places. The two
variables X and Y must be declared external and can, as the following ex￾ample, also be secured against power failure.
