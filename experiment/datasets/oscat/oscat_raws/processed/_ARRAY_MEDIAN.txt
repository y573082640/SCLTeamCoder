Type Function: REAL
Input PT: Pointer (pointer to the array)
SIZE: UINT (size of the array)
Output REAL (median of the array)
The function _ARRAY_MEDIAN calculates the median value of an arbitrary
array of REAL. When called a pointer to the array and its size in bytes is
passed to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads:
_ARRAY_MEDIAN(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of
the array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function, which identifes
the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which deter￾mines the size of the array. In order to determine the median value the ar￾ray referenced by the pointer is sorted in the memory and remains after
function end sorted. The function _ARRAY_MEDIAN thus changes the con￾tents of the array. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
If an array is processed, which should not be changed, so it has to be co￾pied to a temporary array before handing over the Pointer and calling the
function. 
Example: _ARRAY_MEDIAN(ADR(bigarray), SIZEOF(bigarray))
Median Value: 
The median is the middle value to a sorted set of values. 
 Median of (12, 0, 4, 7, 1) is 4 After running the function the array remains 
sorted in memory (0, 1, 4, 7, 12). 
If the array contains an even number of elements the median is the avera￾ge of the two middle values of the array.
