Type Function
Input S1: REAL (side 1)
A: REAL (angles between page 1 and page 2)
S2: REAL (side length 2)
S3: REAL (side length 3)
Output REAL (area of the triangle)
TRIANGLE_A calculates the area of any triangle. The triangle can be defï¿¾ned by either through 2 pages and the pages spanned by the angles 1 and
2 (S1, S2 and A), or if A = 0 then the area is calculated from three sides
(S1, S2 and S3).
