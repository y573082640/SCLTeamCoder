Type Function module
Input SET: BOOL (set input)
PT: TIME (duration of a ramp 0..65535)
E: BOOL (enable input)
UP: BOOL (direction UP = TRUE, means UP ) 
RST: BOOL (Reset input)
Output I/O
BUSY: BOOL (TRUE, when ramp is running)
HIGH: BOOL (maximum output value is reached)
LOW: BOOL (Minimum output value is reached)
RMP_W is a ramp generator with 16-bit (2 bytes) resolution. The ramp of
0.. 65535 is divided into a maximum of 65536 steps and run in a time of
PT once complete. An enable signal E switches the ramp generator on or
of. An asynchronous reset sets each time the output to 0, and a pulse at
the Set input sets the output to 65535. With the UD input, the direction UP
(UD = TRUE) or DOWN (UD = FALSE) is defned. The output of BUSY =
TRUE indicates that a ramp is active. BUSY = FALSE means the output is
stable. The outputs HIGH and LOW gets TRUE, the output OUT reaches the
lower or upper limit (0 and 65535).
At setting of PT is to be noted that a PLC with 5 ms cycle time needs
65536*5 = 327 seconds for a ramp. If the PT is the time defned shorter
than the cycle time 65536, the edge is translated in correspondingly lar￾ger steps. The ramp is constructed in this case with less than 256 steps
per cycle. PT may be T#0s, then the output switched between minimum
and maximum value back and forth.
For a detailed description, see the module RMP_B. The function is absolu￾tely identical except that the output OUT 8-bit wide instead of 16 bit.
