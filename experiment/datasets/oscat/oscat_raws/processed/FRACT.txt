FRACT(3.14) results 0.14.
For X greater than or less than +/- 2.14 * 10^9 Fract always provides a
zero return. As the resolution of a 32bit REAL is a maximum of 8 digits,
from numbers larger or smaller than +/- 2.14 * 10^9 no fractional part can
be determined, because this part can also not be stored in a REAL variaï¿¾ble.
