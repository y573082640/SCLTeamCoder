SIGNAL generates an output signal Q that corresponds to the bit pattern in
SIG. This is Bitpattern is passed in TS long steps. By diferent bit patterns
in SIG, various output signals are generated. If the input IN connected to
TRUE, the module begins to put on output Q in accordance with the SIG
provided Bitpattern . By adapting the Bitpattern diferent output signals
are generated. A Pattern of 10101010, generates an output signal with
50% Duty Cycle and a frequency that is 1/2*S. A Pattern 11110000 by con￾trast, generates an output signal of 50% and a frequency of 1/8*TS. The
start of an output signal is random. The Bit sequence starts at any bit
when the input IN goes to TRUE. If at the input TS no time given then the
module internally uses a default of 1024ms per cycle (a cycle is the cycle
of all 8 bits of a sequence). Typical applications for SIGNAL is the signal ge￾neration for sirens or signal lamps.
