SRAMP generates an output signal which is is limited by the adjustable pa￾rameters. The output follows the input signal and is limited by maximum
speed (VU_MAX and VD_MAX), upper and lower limit (LIMIT_LOW and LI￾MIT_HIGH), and maximum acceleration (A_UP and A_DN). SRAMP is used to
drive motors, for example. The output V passes the current speed of the
output.
In following diagram, the internal process of SRAMP is shown. A ramp ge￾nerator X2, sets the speed of the output change, and a second ramp gene￾rator X3 controls the output.
The Trace Recording shows an example of SRAMP. The input (green) increa￾ses from 0 to 20 and then immediately to 10 while the output increases
with the maximum acceleration to maximum speed. Then is shown that
the Input during the course may change. In this example, it slowed down
in time, so that the output stops exactly at 10. After reaching the end va￾lue 10 of the input switches to -3 and the output Y follows accordingly. 
The input values for A_UP and VU_MAX must be specifed with a positive
sign, A_DN and VD_MAX need a negative sign.
