FT_PID is a PID controller of the following formula works:
Y = KP * ( IN + 1/TN * INTEG(IN) + TV *DERIV(IN))
The control parameters are given in the form of KP, TN and TV, and if the￾re are parameters KP, KI and KD they can be converted using the following
formula:
TN = KP/KI und TV = KD/KP
The input values ILIM_H and ILIM_L limit the working area of the internal
integrator. With RST, the internal integrator will always set to 0. The out￾put LIM signals that the integrator runs one of the limits or ILIM_L ILIM_H.
The PI controller is free running and uses the trapezoidal rule to calculate
the integrator for the highest accuracy and optimal speed. The default va￾lues of the input parameters are predefned as follows: KP = 1, TN = 1s,
TV = 1s, ILIM_L =-1E38 and ILIM_H = +1 E38.
 Anti Wind-Up: Control modules with Integrator tend to the so-called Wind￾Up Efect. A Wind-Up means that the integrator module continuously run
again because, for example, the control signal Y is at a limit and the sys￾tem can not compensate the deviation, which then leads to subsequent
transition into the control range until a long and time-consuming dismant￾ling of the integrator value and the scheme only respond delayed. Since
the integrator is only necessary to compensate the deviation for all other
control units, and the range of the integrator should be limited with the
values of ILIM. The Integrator then reaches a limit and stops remaining at
the last valid value. For other wind- Up Action, the Integrator can be con￾trolled with the input IEN = FALSE any time separately, the Integrator only
runs when IEN = TRUE. 
The following graph illustrates the internal structure of the controller:
FT_PD can be used in conjunction with the modules CTRL_IN and
CTRL_OUT to establish a PD controller.
