TREND monitors the input X and time at the output Q to see if X increases
(Q = TRUE) or X decrease (Q = FALSE). If X does not change, Q remains at
its last value. If X increases, the output TU gets for one cycle to TRUE and
at the output D the result X - LAST_X is displayed. If X is less than LAST_X
so TD gets TRUE for one cycle and the output D is LAST_X - X passed.
LAST_X is an internal value of the module and is the value of X in the last
cycle.
