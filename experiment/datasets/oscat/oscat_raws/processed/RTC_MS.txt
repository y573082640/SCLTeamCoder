Type Function module
Input SET: BOOL (set input)
SDT: DT (set date and time)
SMS: INT (set Milliseconds)
Output XDT: DT (Date and Time Out)
XMS: INT (milliseconds output)
RTC_MS is a clock component with a resolution of milliseconds and date.
The time is automatically every time you SET = TRUE to the value of SDT
and SMS. If SET = FALSE the time is running on their own and provides the
output XDT the current date and time, and at the output XMS milliseconds.
The output XMS counts every second 0-999 and begins with the next se￾cond again at 0. The accuracy of the clock depends on the millisecond Ti￾mer of the PLC.
