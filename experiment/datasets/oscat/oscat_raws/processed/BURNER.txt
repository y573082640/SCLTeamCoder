BURNER is a control interface for oil or gas burner operating at kilowatt
hour meter and counter. The module controls a two-stage burner with op￾tional fuel oil warming. The input IN is the control input that starts the bur￾ner only when the input OVER_TEMP is FALSE. OVER_TEMP is the boiler
thermostat protection, which gets TRUE, if the boiler temperature has rea￾ched the maximum temperature. A burner start begins with the fuel oil
warming, by PRE_HEAT gets TRUE. Then it waits for a signal at the input
OIL_TEMP. If the signal OIL_TEMP is within the PRE_HEAT_TIME not TRUE
and the oil temperature is not reached, the start sequence is interrupted
and the output FAIL is set to TRUE. At the same time the error is spent at
the Output STATUS. After fuel oil warming the motor gets on and sets the
fan in operation. Then after a defned time the ignition is switched and the
oil valve is opened. If no response of the fame sensor after specifed time
(SAFETY_TIME), the module shows a failure. A fault is signaled even if the
fame sensor responds before the ignition. If after a successful ignition, the
fame breaks of and the set-variable MULTIPLE_IGNITION = TRUE, imme￾diately a ignition is started. A second stage is activated automatically after
the time STAGE2_DELAY when the input STAGE2 is TRUE.
If a fault occurs, then the module is locked for a fxed time LOCKOUT_TIME 
and only after this time a RST can start the operation again. During the 
LOCKOUT_TIME, the RST Input must be FALSE. A TRUE at input OVER_TEMP 
stops immediately every action and reports the error 9.
The status output indicates the current state of the module:
 110 = Wait for Start signal ( Standby ) 
111 = startup sequence is executed
112 = burner runs on stage 1
113 = burner runs at stage 2
A number of error conditions are provided at the output STATUS, if an error 
is present:
1 = fuel oil warming has not responded within the PRE_HEAT_TIME
2 = fame sensor is active during fuel oil warming (PRE_HEAT_TIME)
3 = fame sensor is active during the aeration period 
(PRE_VENTILATION_TIME)
4 = safety time ( Safety_Time) was passed without a fame 
5 = fame stops in operation
9 = boiler overheating contact has tripped
Trace recording of a normal boot sequence:
The signal IN starts the sequence with the output PRE_HEAT. After rea￾ching the oil temperature (OIL_TEMP = TRUE), the engine started and the
PRE_VENTILATION_TIME (time from engine start until oil valve is open)
awaited. After an adjustable time (PPR_IGNITION_TIME) before opening the
oil valve, the ignition is turned on. The ignition is then on until the
POST_IGNITION_TIME has expired. The operating time per stage is measu￾red independently in seconds.

sequence:
The timing diagram refects the exact time line:
t1 = pre-heating (PRE_HEAT_TIME)
t2 = prepurge (PRE_VENT_Time)
t3 = pre ignition time (PRE_IGNITE_TIME)
t4 = safety time (SAFETY_TIME)
t5 = post ignition time (POST_IGNITE_TIME)
t6 = delay for stage 2 (STAGE2_DELAY)
