DATE_ADD add days, weeks, months, and add years to a
date. First the module adds the specifed days and weeks, then months
and fnally the years. 
The input values can be both positive as well be negative. So it can also
be subtracted from a date.
Note that especially for negative input values the sum of negative values,
i.e. -3000 days does not run below 1.1.1970 because this would have an
overfow of data type DATE and undefned values are obtained.
