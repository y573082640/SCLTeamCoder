Type Function: REAL
Input PT: Pointer (Pointer to the array) 
SIZE: UINT (size of the array)
Output REAL (maximum value of the array)
The function _ARRAY_REAL calculates the maximum value of an arbitrary
array ofREAL. When called, a pointer to the array and its size in bytes is
passed to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads:
ARRAY_MAX(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of the
array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which identifes the
pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines
the size of the array. In order to determine the maximum, the array refe￾renced by the pointer is scanned directly in memory. The function
ARRAY_MAX does not change the content of the array. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
Example: ARRAY_MAX(ADR(bigarray), SIZEOF(bigarray))
