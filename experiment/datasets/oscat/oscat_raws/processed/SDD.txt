SDD calculates the saturation vapor pressure for water vapor in air. The
temperature T is given in Celsius. The result can be calculated for air over
ice (ICE = TRUE) and for air to water (ICE = FALSE). The scope of the func￾tion is -30°C to 70°C over water and at -60°C to 0°C on ice. The calculati￾on is performed according to the Magnus formula.
