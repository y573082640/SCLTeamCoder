ARRAY_MIN calculates the minimum value of any array of
REAL. When called the function passed a Pointer to the array and its size
in bytes. Under CoDeSys the call reads: ARRAY_MIN(ADR(Array),
SIZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of the array to be manipulated.
ADR() is a standard function, which identifes the pointer to the array and
SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines the size of the array. In
order to determine the maximum, the array referenced by the pointer is
scanned directly in memory. The function ARRAY _ MIN does not change
the contents of the array. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional meï¿¾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
