M_T measures the time how long IN was TRUE. PT is the time from the 
rising edge of signal IN to the falling edge of the IN signal. The Output ET 
passes the elapsed time since the last rising edge to falling edge. As long 
as the input signal is FALSE, ET = 0. M_T requires a rising edge to trigger 
the measurement. If at the frst call IN is already TRUE, it is not seen as a 
rising edge. For more examples, see the description of M_TX. With TRUE at 
the input RST, the outputs can always be reset to 0. If ET reaches the 
value of TMAX, automatically a reset is generated in the module to reset 
all outputs to 0. TMAX is internally assigned with default value of T#10d 
and normally can be unconnected.
