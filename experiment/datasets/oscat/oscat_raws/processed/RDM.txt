RDM calculates a pseudo- random number. This is the PLC's internal Timer
read and converted into a pseudo-random number. Because RDM's is writ￾ten as a function and not as a function module, it can not save data bet￾ween 2 calls and should therefore be used with caution. RDM is only called
once per cycle, it produces reasonable good results. But when it is repea￾tedly called within a cycle, it delivers the same number, most likely becau￾se of the PLC timer is still on the same value. If the function is repeatedly
used within a cycle, so it must be passed with each call a diferent number
of starts (LAST). It shall be called only once per cycle, is sufcient to call
RDM(0). As a starting number for each call, the last calculated number of
RDM can be used. Supplied by RDM random numbers between 0 and 1,
which does not contain 1 (0 <=random number < 1)
