LIST_INSERT puts an element at the position POS in a list. The list consists
of Strings (elements) that begin with the separation character SEP. The
frst element of the list is at position 1. If a position greater than the last
element of the list is given, empty elements are added to the list until INS
is at its normal position at the end of the list. If POS = 0, the new element
will be placed to the top of the list.
