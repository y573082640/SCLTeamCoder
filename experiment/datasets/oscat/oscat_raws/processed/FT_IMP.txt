FT_IMP is a high-pass flter with time constant T and multiplier K. An abï¿¾rupt change at the input is visible at the output, but after the time T the
value is already smoother by 63% and after 3 * T by 95%. Thus, after an
abrupt change of the input signal from 0 to 10, the output passes 10 at
the beginning and reduces after 1* T to 3.7 and after 3 * T to 0.5 and then
gradually to 0.
