PRESSURE converts diferent, in practice common units, for
pressure. Normally, only the input to be converted is occupied and the re￾maining inputs remain free. However, if several inputs loaded with values,
the values of all inputs are converted accordingly and then summed.
1 MWS = 1 meter of water = 0.0980665 Bar
1 Torr = 1 mm Hg = 0.133322 bar = 101325/760 Pa
1 ATT = 1 kp / cm ² = 0.980665 bar
1 ATM = 1.01325 Bar
1 PA = 1 N / m²
1 BAR = 105 Pa
