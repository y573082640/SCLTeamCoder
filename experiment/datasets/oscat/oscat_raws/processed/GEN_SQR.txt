Type Function module
Input PT: TIME (period time)
AM: REAL (signal amplitude)
OS: REAL (signal ofset)
DC: REAL (duty cycle 0..1)
DL: REAL (signal delay 0..1 * PT )
Output Q: BOOL (binary output)
OUT: REAL (analog output)
GEN_SQR is a sqare wave generator with programmable period, adjustable
amplitude and signal ofset and duty cycle DC ( Duty Cycle ). A special
feature is a adjustable delay so that with multiple generators overlapping
signals can be generated.
The following Example shows 2 GEN_SQR, one runs with a delay of 0.25 (Â¼ 
period). In the trace record clearly shows the signal of the frst generator 
and the delayed signal of the second generator.
