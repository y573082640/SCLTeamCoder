Type Function : INT
Input STR: STRING ( string to be copied)
POS: INT (position from which the string is copied into the buf￾fer) 
PT: POINTER TO BYTE (address of the Bufer ) 
SIZE: UINT (size of the bufer)
Output INT (returns the position in bufer post the imported string
)
The function _STRING_TO_BUFFER copies a string in any array of Byte .
The string is stored from any position POS in the bufer. The frst element
in the array has the position number 0. When called, a pointer to the array
and its size in bytes is passed to the function. Under CoDeSys the call
reads: _STRING_TO_BUFFER(STR, POS, ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where
array is the name of the array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard
function which identifes the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a stan￾dard function, which determines the size of the array. The function returns
the string copied from the bufer as STRING. The array specifed by the
pointer is manipulated directly in memory. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
Example:
_STRING_TO_BUFFER(STR, POS, ADR(bigarray), SIZEOF(bigarray))
