PWM_DC is a Duty - cycle modulated frequency generator. The generator
generates a fxed frequency F with a duty cycle (TON / TOFF) which can be
modulated (adjusted) by the input DC. A value of 0.5 at the input DC geï¿¾nerates a duty cycle of 50%. 
The following image shows an output signal with a duty - cycle 2 / 1, which
corresponds to a DC (ratio) of 0.67.
