SET_DATE calculates a Date (DATE) from the input values,
day, month and year. SET_DATE does not test the validity of a date. For
example, also be February, 30th will be set, which, of course results the
1st March or in a leap year, the March, 2nd. SET_DATE can therefore also
be used to generate any day of the year. This can be a quite practicable
application. In this case, the monthly amount may also be 0. An invalid
month always gives a date in relation to January. An invalid month (month
< 1 or month > 12) is always interpreted as January.
