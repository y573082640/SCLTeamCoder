FT_PIWL is a PI controller with dynamic anti-wind Up and works according
the following formular: 
Y = KP * IN + KI * INTEG(IN)
The input values LIM_H and LIM_L limit the range of the output Y. With
RST, the internal Integrator can always be set to 0. The output LIM indica￾tes that the Output Y runs to one of the limits LIM_L orL IM_H. The PI con￾troller is free running and uses the trapezoidal rule to calculate the inte￾grator for the highest accuracy and optimal speed. The default values of
the input parameters are predefned as follows: KP = 1, CI = 1, ILIM_L=
-1E38 and ILIM_H = +1E38. 
Anti Wind-Up: Control modules with Integrator tend to the so-called Wind￾Up Efect. A Wind-Up means that the integrator module continuously run
again because, for example, the control signal Y is at a limit and the sys￾tem can not compensate the deviation, which then leads to subsequent
transition into the control range until a long and time-consuming dismant￾ling of the integrator value and the scheme only respond delayed. Since
the integrator is only necessary to compensate the deviation for all other
control units, and the range of the integrator should be limited with the
values of ILIM.
The module FT_PIWL has a so-called dynamic-wind Up Reset which resets
reaching a limit (LIM_L, LIM_H) the Integrator to a value corresponding of
the output limit. After reaching a Limits the controller re-enters the work
area must the Integrator are not frst or Down-integrated, and the control￾ler is ready for use without delay. The dynamic Anti-Wind Up Method is
that in most cases without drawbacks preferred method, because it does
not negatively afect the control and prevents the disadvantages of
Wind_Up . 
The following graph illustrates the internal structure of the controller:
FT_PIWL can used together with the modules CTRL_IN and CTRL_OUT to
build complex controllers.
