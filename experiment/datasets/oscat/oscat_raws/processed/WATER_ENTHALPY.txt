WATER_ENTHALPY calculates the Enthalpy (Heat content) of liquid water
as a function of temperature at atmospheric pressure. The temperature T
is given in Celsius. The calculation is valid for a temperature of 0 to 100 °
C and the result is the amount of heat needed to head the water from 0 °
C to a temperature of T. The result is expressed in joules / gram J / g and
passed as KJ/Kg. It is calculated by linear interpolation in steps of 10 ° and
thus reach a sufcient accuracy for non-scientifc applications. A possible
Application of WATER_ENTHALPY is to calculate the amount of energy nee￾ded, for example, to head a bufer tank at X (T2 - T1) degree. From the
energy required then the runtime of a boiler can be calculated exactly and
the required energy can be provided. Since there temperature readings
are signifcantly delays, with this method a better heating is possible in
practice.
