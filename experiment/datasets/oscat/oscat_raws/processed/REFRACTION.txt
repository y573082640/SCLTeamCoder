Type Function: REAL
Input ELEV: REAL (elevation in degrees above the horizon)
Output REAL (refraction in degrees)
REFRACTION calculates the atmospheric refraction outside the atmosphe￾re and celestial bodies. A celestial body appears by the refraction of light
in the atmosphere by the refraction higher above the horizon than he ac￾tually is. The refraction is 0 at the zenith (at 12:00 noon) and increases
much close to the horizon. At 0° (the horizon), the refraction is -0.59° and
10° above the horizon, it is 0.09°. The refraction is needed to calculated
orbits of celestial bodies and to correct satellite so that they match with
observation. The module calculates an average value for the pressure of
1010mBar and 10° C. When the sun is actually at 0°, so exactly in the ho￾rizon, it appears above the horizon because of refraction at 0.59 degrees .
The visible sun position is the actual (astronomical) sun position H + the
refraction of the sun. The refraction angle is also calculated below the ho￾rizon ELEV < - 2°, so that below the horizon always the refraction is added
to the astronomical refraction angle, so as the distance to the sun can be
calculated correctly at any time. For astronomical angle < -1.9 ° is the re￾fraction remains constant at 0.744 degrees.
