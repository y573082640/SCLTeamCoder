BOILER is a Controllerfor bufers such as warm water bufer. With two se￾parate temperature sensor inputs also storage layers can be controlled.
With the setup variable T_LOWER_ENABLE the lower temperature sensor
can be switched on and of. When the input ENABLE = TRUE, the boiler is
heated (HEAT = TRUE) until the preset temperature T_LOWER_MAX rea￾ches the lower area of the bufer and then turn of the heater, until the
lower limit temperature of the upper region (T_UPPER_MIN) is reached. If
T_LOWER_ENABLE is set to FALSE, the lower sensor is not evaluated and it
control the temperature between T_UPPER_MIN and T_UPPER_MAX at the
top. A PRESSURE-input protects the boiler and prevents the heating, if not
enough water pressure in the boiler is present. If a pressure sensor is not
present, the input is unconnected. As further protection are the default va￾lues T_PROTECT_LOW (antifreeze) and T_PROTECT_HIGH are available and
prevent the temperature in the bufer to not exceed an upper limit and
also a lower limit. If an error occurs, the output ERROR is set to TRUE, whi￾le a status byte is reported at output STATUS, which can be further evalua￾ted by modules such as ESR_COLLECT. By a rising edge at input BOOST
the bufer temperature is directly heated to T_UPPER_MAX (T_LOWER_ENA￾BLE = FALSE) or T_LOWER_MAX (T_LOWER_ENABLE = TRUE). BOOST can
be used to impairment heating up the boiler when ENABLE is set to FALSE.
The heating by BOOST is edge-triggered and leads during each rising edge
at BOOST to exactly one heating process. Due to a rising edge on BOOST
while ENABLE = TRUE the heating is started immediately until the maxi￾mum temperature is reached. The boiler will be loaded to provide maxi￾mum heat capacity. The inputs REQ_1 and REQ_2 serve any time to provi￾de a preset temperature (or T_REQUEST_1 T_REQUEST_2). REQ can be
used for example to provide a higher temperature for legionella disinfecti￾on or for other purposes. The provision of the request temperatures is
made by measuring at the upper temperature sensor and with a 2-point
control whose hysteresis is set by T_REQUEST_HYS.

3 lower temperature sensor has exceeded the upper limit temperature
4 lower temperature sensor has fallen below the lower limit temperature
5 Water pressure in the bufer is too small
