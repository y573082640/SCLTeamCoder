FACT calculates the factorial of X. 
It is defned for input values from 0 .. 12. For values less than zero and
greater than 12 is the result -1. For the factorial of larger numbers, the
GAMMA function is suitable.
For natural numbers X: X! = 1*2*3...*(X-1)*X, 0! = 1
Faculties of negative or non-whole numbers are not defned.
