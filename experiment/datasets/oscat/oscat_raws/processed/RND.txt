RND in￾ternally uses the standard function TRUNC() which converts the input va￾lue to an INTEGER type DINT. This may come as an overfow because DINT
can store in maximum +/-2.14*10^9. The range of the RND is therefore li-
mited to +/-2.14*10^9 . See also the ROUND function which rounds the in￾put value to N decimal places.
