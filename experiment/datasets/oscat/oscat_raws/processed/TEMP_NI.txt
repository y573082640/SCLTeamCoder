Type Function: REAL
Input RES: REAL (resistance in ohms)
R0: REAL (resistance at 0° C)
Output REAL (measured temperature)
RES_NI calculates the temperature of a NI-resistance from the RES sensor
input values (measured resistance value) and R0 (resistance at 0°C).
The calculation is suitable for a temperature range of -60.. +180 ° C and
made by the following formal:
RES_NI = R0 + A*T + B*T²+C*T4
A = 0.5485; B = 0.665E-3; C = 2.805E-9
