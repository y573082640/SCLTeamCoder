D_TRIG triggers on any change in the DWORD-input IN. If the input 
value has changed, the output Q for a PLC cycle is set to TRUE and the 
output X indicates how much has changed in the IN input. The input and 
output are of type DWORD. The input can also process WORD and BYTE 
types. With output X it should be noted that DWORD is unsigned and 
therefore a change of -1 at the input is not -1, but the number 2^32-2 at 
the output. With the standard function DWORD_TO_INT the output X can 
be converted to an integer, which displays also negative changes correctly.
The following example shows the application of D_TRIG when the input
changes value from 5 to 2:
