CALIBRATE serves for calibrating an analog signal. In order to allow a cali￾brating two reference values (Y_OFFSET and Y_SCALE) must be set by dou￾ble-clicking on the icon of the module. Y_OFFSET is the starting value at
which the ofset is set by a pulse at CO and Y_SCALE is the value at which
the gain is determined. A calibration can only be successful if the frst of￾set and gain are then calibrated.
