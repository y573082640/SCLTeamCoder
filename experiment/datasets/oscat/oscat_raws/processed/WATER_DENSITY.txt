Type Function : REAL
Input T: REAL (temperature of the water)
SAT: BOOL (TRUE, if the water is saturated with air)
Output REAL (water density in grams / liter)
WATER_DENSITIY calculates the density of liquid water as a function of
temperature at atmospheric pressure. The temperature T is given in Celsi￾us. The highest density reached water at 3.983 °C with 999.974950 grams
per liter. WATER_DENSITY calculates the density of liquid water, not frozen
or evaporated water. WATER_DENSITY calculates the density of air-free wa￾ter when SAT = FALSE, and air-saturated water when SAT = TRUE. The cal￾culated values are calculated using an approximate formula and results
values with an accuracy greater than 0.01% in the temperature range of 0
- 100°C at a constant pressure of 1013 mBar.
The deviation of the density of air saturated with water is corrected accor￾ding to the formula of Bignell.
The dependence of the density of water pressure is relatively low at about
0.046 kg/m³ per 1 bar pressure increase, in the range up to 50 bar. The
low pressure dependence has practical applications, no signifcant infu￾ence.
