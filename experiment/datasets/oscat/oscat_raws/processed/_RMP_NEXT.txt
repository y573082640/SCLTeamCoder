Type Function module
Input E: BOOL ( Enable Input) 
IN: BOOL (input)
TR: TIME (rise time for ramp from 0..255)
TF: TIME (fall time for ramp 255..0)
TL: TIME (lock time between a change of direction)
I / O I/O
OUTPUT DIR: BOOL (direction of change in IN)
UP: BOOL (signals a rising ramp)
DN: BOOL (signals a falling ramp)
RMP_NEXT follows at the output OUT to the input signal IN with the in TR
and TF defned rising or falling fanks. Unlike RMP_SOFT the fank of
RMP_NEXT runs until it underrun or overrun the endpoint and is therefore
suitable for control tasks. Changing the value of IN so a rising ramp with
TR or a falling fank with TF starts at the output OUT until the value of OUT
has overrun or underrun the IN. The output then remains at this value. The
outputs of UP and DN shows just whether a rising or a falling edge are
created. The output DIR indicates the direction of change at IN, if IN is not
changed, the output remains at the last state. The lock time TL determiï¿¾nes the delay time between the direction reversal.
The following graph shows the waveform at OUT when changing the input
signal at IN:
