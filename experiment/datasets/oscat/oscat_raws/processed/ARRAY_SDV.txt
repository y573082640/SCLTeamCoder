ARRAY_SDV calculates the standard deviation (Standard De￾viation) value of an arbitrary array of REAL. When called a pointer to the
array and its size in bytes is passed to the function. Under CoDeSys the
call reads: ARRAY_SDV(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where array is the
name of the array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function, which
identifes the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function,
which determines the size of the array. In order to determine the maxi￾mum, the array referenced by the pointer is scanned directly in memory.
The function ARRAY_SDV does not change the contents of the array. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
