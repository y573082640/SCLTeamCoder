Type Function: BOOL
Input PT: Pointer (Pointer to the array) 
SIZE: UINT (size of the array)
INIT: REAL (initial value)
Output BOOL (TRUE)
The function _ARRAY_INIT initializes an arbitrary array of REAL with an in￾itial value. When called, a pointer to the array and its size in bytes is
transferred to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads:
_ARRAY_INIT(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array), INIT), where array is the name of
the array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which identifes
the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which deter￾mines the size of the array. The function only returns TRUE. The array spe￾cifed by the pointer is manipulated directly in memory. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
Example: _ARRAY_INIT(ADR(bigarray), SIZEOF(bigarray), 0)
initialized bigarray with 0.
