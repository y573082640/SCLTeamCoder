SENSOR_INT calculate the sensor resistance, taking into account the para￾sitic resistances, which usually afect the measurement. The A / D conver￾ter measures either current at a fxed voltage or voltage at a fxed current.
The resulting resistance is not only the resistance of the sensor, but is
composed of the resistance of the sensor and two parasitic resistances RS
and RP. Since the parasitic resistances remain constant, they can be com￾pensated and the real resistance of the sensor can be calculated.
Between the terminals A and B measured resistance (measured by current
and voltage) is a total resistance of the sensor resistance in parallel to the
parasitic resistance RP and the line resistance RS. RS and RP, are compen￾sated the real resistance RX is calculated. The modules can TEMP_ then be
calculated as the exact temperature.
