_ARRAY_SORT(ADR(Array), SI￾ZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of the array to be manipulated.
ADR() is a standard function which identifes the pointer to the array and
SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines the size of the array.
The function only returns TRUE. The array specifed by the pointer is mani￾pulated directly in memory. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
