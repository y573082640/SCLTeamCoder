FT_PROFILE generates a time-dependent output signal. The output signal
is defned by time - value pairs. FT_PROFILE generate a output signal Y by
the value pairs are connected by ramps. A typical application for FT_PRO￾FILE is to generate a temperature profle for a furnace, but also every app￾lication which requires a time-dependent control signal provides an appli￾cation. The time-dependent output signal is initiated by a rising edge at E
and then runs automatically. After the pair of values (TIME_10, VALUE_10)
the output signal remains to VALUE_10, until the input E = FALSE. With an
edge to E the signal can be started and additionally, the input E will also
used to extend the signal indefnitely. This makes it possible to create a
course to the value VALUE_3, to stretch it with E and after the falling edge
of E again to create a course back to baseline. With the inputs K, M and O,
the output signal can be stretched and scaled dynamically.
Y = value generated * K + O
The input M is used for stretching of the signal over time. The actual time
course is consistent with the defned time course through the setup over
time multiplied by M. In order to ensure linear ramp, a time extension by
M works only after completion of an edge. The output RUN is set with a ri￾sing edge of E to TRUE and is only after the time profle FALSE again. At
the output of ET, the time elapsed since start time can be read.
The following graphs show the output for the values:
VALUE_0 = 0
TIME_1, VALUE_1 = 1s, 50
TIME_2, VALUE_2 = 3s, 50
TIME_3, VALUE_3 = 4s, 100
TIME_10, VALUE_10 = 6s, 100
TIME_11, VALUE_11 = 7s, 50
TIME_12, VALUE_12 = 9s, 50
TIME_13, VALUE_13 = 10s, 0
The graphs represent the output of both phase 3 is stretched by E, and wi￾thout stretching.
