INC adds to the input X the Value D and ensures that the output INC is not
does not exceed the value of M. If the result from the addition of X and D
is greater than M, then it starts again at 0. The feature is especially useful
when addressing arrays and bufers. Even the positioning of absolute enï¿¾coders it can be used. INC can be used to decrementieren with a negative
D, while INC will ensure that the result is not below zero. If subtract 1 from
zero INC starts again at M.
INC: = X + D, because D can take the maximum value M.
If INC > M so INC starts again at 0.
If INC < 0 so INC starts again at M
