Type Function module
Input START: BOOL (input)
STOP: BOOL (input)
TMAX : TIME (Timeout f√ºr ET)
RST: BOOL (Reset input)
Output PT: TIME (elapsed time)
ET: TIME (Elapsed time since last rising edge)
RUN: BOOL (TRUE if measure processes)
M_D measures the time between a rising edge of START and a rising edge 
on STOP. PT is the result of the last measurement. Output ET is the elapsed 
time since the last rising edge of START. M_d requires a rising edge to start 
the measurement. If at the frst call already START is TRUE, it is not seen 
as a rising edge. Even if STOP is TRUE, a rising edge of START is not 
counted. Only when all start conditions (STOP = FALSE, RST: = FALSE and 
rising edge at START) are present, the output RUN gets TRUE and a 
measurement is started. With TRUE at the input RST, the outputs can 
always be reset to 0. If ET reaches the value of TMAX, automatically a 
reset is generated in the module to reset all outputs to 0. TMAX is 
internally assigned with default value of T#10d and normally can be 
unconnected. TMAX serves to defne a maximum value range for PT. The 
output RUN is TRUE if is a measurement is processed.
