Type Function : INT
Input STR: STRING ( string to be copied)
POS: INT (position from which the string is copied into the buf￾fer) 
PT: POINTER TO BYTE (address of the Bufer ) 
SIZE: UINT (size of the bufer)
Output INT (position in bufer post included string
The function _BUFFER_INSERT copies a string in any array of Byte and mo￾ves the rest of the array to the length of the string. The string is stored
from any position POS in the bufer. The frst element in the array has the
position number 0. When called, a pointer to the array and its size in bytes
is passed to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads:
_BUFFER_INSERT(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of
the array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which identifes
the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which deter￾mines the size of the array. The function returns the string copied from the
bufer as STRING. The array specifed by the pointer is manipulated direct￾ly in memory. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
Example: _BUFFER_INSERT(STR, POS, ADR(bigarray), SIZEOF(bigarray))
