Type Function module
Input E0..3: BOOL (release signal for Q0..3)
Setup T0..3: TIME (cycle time)
Output Q0..3: BOOL (output signals) 
SCHEDULER is used to call time dependent program parts. For example,
complex calculations that are needed only rarely, can be called at fxed in￾tervals. The outputs Q? of the module will be active only for one cycle and
release the execution of the program part. The setup time T? specify at
which intervals the outputs are enabled. SCHEDULER checks per CPU cy￾cle only one output, so that in maximum one output per cycle can be acti￾ve. In the extreme case when all call times T? are T#0s, in each cycle one
output should be set, so that frst Q0, then Q1, etc. to Q3 are set and then
again to start Q0. The call times can therefore up to 3 CPU cycles and dif￾fer from the predetermined value T? .
