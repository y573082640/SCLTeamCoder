Input CS: BOOL (edge-sensitive Set)
CR: BOOL (edge-sensitive reset)
RST: BOOL (asynchronous reset)
Output Q: BOOL (output)
FF_RSE an edge-triggered RS fip-fop. The output Q is set by a rising edge
of CS and cleared by a rising edge on CR. If both edges (CS and CR) rise at
the same time, the output is set to FALSE. An asynchronous reset input
RST sets the output at any time to FALSE.
