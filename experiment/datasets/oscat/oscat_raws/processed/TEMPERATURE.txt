TEMPERATURE converts diferent, in practice common used units for
temperature. Normally, only the input to be converted is occupied and the
remaining inputs remain free. However, if several inputs loaded with va￾lues, the values of all inputs are converted accordingly and then summed.
1 K = 273.15 °C
1 °C = 273.15 K
1 °F = °C * 1.8 + 32
1 Re = °C * 0.8
1 Ra = K * 1.8
