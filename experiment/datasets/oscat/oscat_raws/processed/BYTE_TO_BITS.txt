BYTE_TO_BITS split a byte (IN) into its individual bits (B0 .. B7). The input
IN is defned as a DWORD to handle either byte, word, or DWORD at the
input. If a Word or DWORD used at the input, only the bits 0th .7 are proï¿¾cessed. A DWORD can then, using the default command SHR , be shifted
by 8 bits to the right and then the next byte can be processed.
