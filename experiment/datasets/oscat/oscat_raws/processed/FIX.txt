FIX creates a string of fxed length N. The string STR at the input is trunca￾ted to the length N respective flled with the fll character C. If the string
STR is shorter than the length L to be created, will the string be flled de￾pending on M, with the fll character C. If M = 0, the padding at the end of
the string is appended, if M = 1, the padding is attached the beginning
and when M = 2, the string is centered between fll character. If the num￾ber of the necessary padding is odd and if M = 2, the fll at the end has a
fll character more than at the beginning. The FIX function evaluates the
Global Setup string_length constant and limits the maximum length L of
the string to string_length.
