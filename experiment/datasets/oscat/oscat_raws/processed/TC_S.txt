TC_S determines the last cycle time, that is the time since the last call of
the module has passed. The time will be delivered in seconds, but has an
accuracy in microseconds. The module calls the function T_PLC_US().
T_PLC_US () returns the internal PLC Timer in microseconds with a step
width of 1000 microseconds. If a higher resolution is required the function
T_PLC_US() has to be adjusted to the appropriate system.
