FT_AVG calculates a moving average over each of
the last N values. By the input RST, the stored values can be deleted. N is
defned from 0 .. 32. N = 0 means that the output signal = input signal. N
= 5 is the average over the last 5 values. The average is calculated over a
maximum of 32 values. With input E can be control when the input is read.
This allows a simple way to connect a sample and a hold module, such as
SH_1 with FT_AVG can be linked. The frst call to FT_AVG the bufer load
the input signal to avoid that a Ramp-up takes place. 
The following example reads SH_1 once a second the input value Signal_In
and passes these values once per second to FT_AVG, which then forms out
of the last 8 values the mean value.
