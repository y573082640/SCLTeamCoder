ARRAY_SPR determines the dispersion of an arbitrary array of
REAL. The dispersion is the maximum value in the array minus the mini￾mum value of the array. When called, a Pointer to the array and its size in
bytes is transferred to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads:
ARRAY_SPR(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of the ar￾ray to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which identifes the
pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines
the size of the array. In order to determine the maximum, the array refe￾renced by the pointer is scanned directly in memory. The function
ARRAY_SPR does not change the content of the array. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
