GEN_SIN is a sine wave generator with programmable period, adjustable
amplitude and signal ofset. A special feature is a adjustable delay so that
with multiple generators overlapping signals can be generated. A Binary
Output Q passes a logical signal, which is generated phase equal to the
sine signal. The input DL is a delay for the output signal. The Delay is speï¿¾cifed with DL * PT. A DL of 0.5 delays the signal by half a period. 
The following example shows GEN_SIN with a trace recording of the sine
signal and the binary output Q.
The above example generates a sine wave with 0.1 Hz (PT = 10 s) and a
lower peak value of 0 and upper peak value of 10.
