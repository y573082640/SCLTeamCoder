LANGEVIN Function is very similarto sigmoid function, but more
slowly approaching the limits. In contrast to the sigmoid are the values at
-1 and +1. The Langevin function is mainly at CPUs without foating point
unit much faster than the Sigmoid function.
The following chart shows the progress of the Langevin function:
