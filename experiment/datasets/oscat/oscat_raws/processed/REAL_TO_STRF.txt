REAL_TO_STRF converts a REAL value to a string with a fxed number of
decimal N. At the conversion entirely in a normal number format XXX.NNN
is converted. At the conversion IN is rounded to N digits after the decimal
point and then converted into a String to the format XXX.NNN. When N =
0, the REAL number is rounded to 0 digits after the decimal point and the
result is passed as an integer without a point and decimal places. If the
number IN is less than, as with N decimal places can be captured, a zero is
passed. The decimal places are always flled up to N digits with zeros. The
maximum string length is 20 digits. The D input determines which characï¿¾ter represents the decimal point.
