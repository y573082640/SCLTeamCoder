BUFFER_COMP checks whether the content of the array PT2
occurs in the array PT1 from position START. If PT2 is found in PT1, so the
function returns the position in PT1, starting from 0. If PT2 is not found in
PT1, -1 is returned. BUFFER_COMP can also be used for comparison of two
equally sized arrays.
When called, a Pointer to the array and its size in bytes is passed to the
function. In CoDeSys the call reads: BUFFER_COMP(ADR(BUF1),
SIZEOF(BUF1), ADR(BUF2), SIZEOF(BUF2)), where BUF1 and BUF2 are the
names of the arrays to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which
indentifes the Pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function,
which determines the size of the array. The function only returns TRUE.
The array specifed by the Pointer is manipulated directly in memory. This
type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional memory
is required and no surrender values must be copied.
