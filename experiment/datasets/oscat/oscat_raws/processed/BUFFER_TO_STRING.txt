BUFFER_TO_STRING (ADR (Array),
SIZEOF (ARRAY), START, STOP), ARRAY is the name of the array. ADR() is a
standard function which identifes the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is
a standard function, which determines the size of the array. The function
returns the string copied from the bufer as STRING. This type of procesï¿¾sing arrays is very efcient because no additional memory is required and
no surrender values must be copied.
