Type Function : STRING
Input PT: POINTER TO BYTE (address of the Bufer ) 
SIZE: UINT (size of the bufer)
START: UINT (position from which the String will be from the
bufer 
copied)
STOP: UINT (end of Strings in the bufer) 
Output STRING (a string that was copied from the bufer)
The function BUFFER_To_STRING extracts a String from any array of Byte.
The String is copied from any position START from the bufer and ends at
the STOP position. The frst element in the array is at position number 0.
When called aPointer to the array and its size in bytes is passed to the
function. Under CoDeSys the call reads: BUFFER_TO_STRING (ADR (Array),
SIZEOF (ARRAY), START, STOP), ARRAY is the name of the array. ADR() is a
standard function which identifes the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is
a standard function, which determines the size of the array. The function
returns the string copied from the bufer as STRING. This type of procesï¿¾sing arrays is very efcient because no additional memory is required and
no surrender values must be copied.
Example: BUFFER_TO_STRING(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(ARRAY), START, STOP)
