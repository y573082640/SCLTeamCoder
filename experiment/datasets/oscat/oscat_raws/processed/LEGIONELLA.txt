LEGIONELLA has an integrated timer, which starts on a certain day (DAY)
to a specifc time of day (T_START) the desinfection. For this purpose, the
external interface of the local time is needed (DT_IN). Each time can be
started the desinfection by hand with a rising edge at MANUAL.
The process of a disinfection cycle is started with an internal start due to
DT_IN, DAY and T_START, or by a rising edge at MANUAL. The output HEAT
is TRUE and controls the heating of the boiler. Within the heating time
T_MAX_HEAT the input signal TEMP_BOILER must go then to TRUE. If the
temperature is not reported within T_MAX_HEAT, the output STATUS pas￾ses fault. The disinfection then continues anyway. After the heating, the
heater temperature is measured and reheated if necessary by TRUE at the
output HEAT. When the boiler temperature is reached, PUMP gets TRUE
and the circulation pump is turned on. Then the individual valves are ope￾ned one after the other and measured, whether within the time
T_MAX_RETURN the temperature war reached at the return of the circulati￾on line. If a return fow thermometer is not present, the input T_MAX_RE￾TURN remains open.
The output STATE is compatible with ESR, and may give the following mes￾sages:
110 On hold 
111 Sequence run
1 Boiler temperature was not reached
2 Return temperature at Ventil0 was not reached
3..8 Return temperature at valve1..7 was not reached

The following example shows a simulation for 2 disinfection circuits with 
trace recording. In this structure, VALVE2 connected to the input RST and 
thus disrupts the sequence after of two circles:
