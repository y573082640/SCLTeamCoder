Type Function: BOOL
Input PT: Pointer (Pointer to the array) 
SIZE: UINT (size of the array)
X: REAL (multiplier)
Output BOOL (TRUE)
The function _ARRAY_MUL multiply each element of an arbitrary array of
REAL with the value X. When called a Pointer to the array and its size in
bytes is passed to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads:
_ARRAY_MUL(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array), X), where array is the name of
the array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which identifes
the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which deter￾mines the size of the array. The function only returns TRUE. The array spe￾cifed by the pointer is manipulated directly in memory. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
Call: _ARRAY_MUL(ADR(bigarray), SIZEOF(bigarray), X)
Example: [0,-2,3,-1-5], X = 3 is converted into [0, -6,9,-3,-15]
