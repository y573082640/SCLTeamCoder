Type Function : REAL
Input VC: REAL (water vapor concentration in air, in grams / m³)
T: REAL (temperature in °C)
Output REAL (Relative humidity in %)
The module DEW_RH calculates the relative humidity in % (50 = 50%)
from the water vapor concentration (VC) and temperature (T in ° C) . The
water vapor concentration is measured in grams / m³. DEW_CON can be
used for calculations in both directions (heat up and cool down). If cooled
too much, then the maximum relative humidity limited to 100%. For calcu￾lation of the dew point of the module DEW_TEMP is recommended.
In the following example, the case will be calculated when air is cooled
from 30°C and relative humidity of 50% by 6 degrees. The module
DEW_CON provides the moisture concentration in the outlet air of 30° and
DEW_RH calculates the resulting relative humidity RH of 69.7%. These cal￾culations are important when air is cooled or heated. In air conditioning
systems a resulting relative humidity of 100% hast to be avoided due to
condensation and the resulting problems.
