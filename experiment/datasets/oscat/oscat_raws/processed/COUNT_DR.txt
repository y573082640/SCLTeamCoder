Input SET: BOOL (Asynchronous Set)
IN: DWORD (default value for set)
UP: BOOL (forward switch edge-triggered)
DN: BOOL (reverse switch edge-triggered)
STEP: DWORD (increment of Counters)
MX: DWORD (maximum value of the Counters)
RST: BOOL (asynchronous reset)
Output CNT: DWORD (output)
COUNT_DR is a DWORD (32-bit) counter with counts from 0 to MX and
then begins again at 0. The counter can, using two edge-triggered inputs
UP and DN, both forward and backward counting. when reaching a fnal
value 0 or MX it counts again at 0 or MX. The STEP input sets the incre￾ment value of the counter. With a TRUE at input SET the counter is set to
present value at the IN input. A reset input RST resets the counter at any
time to 0.

If the independent inputs UP and DN with CLK and a control input UP/DN
should be replaced, id can be done using two AND gates at the inputs:
