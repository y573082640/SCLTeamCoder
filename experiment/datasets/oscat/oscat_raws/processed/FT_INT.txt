FT_INT is an integrator module which provides the integral of the input si￾gnal at the output. The input K is a multiplier for the output signal. Run
switches the integrator on if TRUE and of when FALSE. RST (reset) sets
the output to 0. The inputs OUT_MIN and OUT_MAX serve upper and lower
limits for the output of the integrator . FT_INT 
works internally in microseconds and is thus fulfll also the requirements
very fast PLC controller with cycle times under one millisecond.
A fundamental problem with integrator is the resolution.The output of type
real has a resolution of 7-8 points. This will result in a calculated integrati-
on step of 1 at an output value of more than one hundred million (1E8).
Thus the step can not be added up because it falls below the resolution li￾mit of a maximum of 8 points in type Real. This limitation is important
when using FT_INT.
For example, an input signal of 0.0001 would be at a sampling time of 1
millisecond and a baseline of 100000 to add a value of 0.0001 * 0.001 se￾conds = 0.000001 to the baseline of 100000, which inevitably results in
the value of 100000 again, because the resolution of the data type Real
can only collect up to 8. This should be considered especially if FT_INT
should serve as a utility meter or similar applications.
