FRMP_B calculates the value of a ramp at a given time TD. The module enï¿¾sures that no bufer overrun or underrun can take place at the output. The
output value is limited in all cases to 0 .. 255. TR sets the time for a full
ramp 0 .. 255 and TD is the elapsed time. If DIR = TRUE, a rising ramp is
calculated and if DIR = FALSE a falling edge. With the start value an edge
can be calculated from any starting point.
