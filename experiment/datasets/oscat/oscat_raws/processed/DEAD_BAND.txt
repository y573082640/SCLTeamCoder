DEAD_BAND is a linear transfer function with dead zone. The function moï¿¾ves the positive part of the curve to -L and the negative part of the curve
by +L. DEAD_BAND is used to flter a quantization noise and other noise
components from a signal. DEAD_BAND, for example, is used in control
systems in order to prevent that the controller permanently switches in
small increments, while the actuator is overstressed and worn out.
DEAD_BAND = X - SGN(X)*L if ABS(X)> L if ABS(X) > L 
DEAD_BAND = 0 if ABS(X) <= L
