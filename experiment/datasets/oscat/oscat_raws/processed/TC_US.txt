TC_US determines the last cycle time, that is the time since the last call of
the module has passed. The time comes in milliseconds. The module calls
the function T_PLC_US(). T_PLC_US () returns the internal PLC Timer in miï¿¾croseconds with a step width of 1000 microseconds. If a higher resolution
is required the function T_PLC_US() has to be adjusted to the appropriate
system.
