Type Function module
Input SET: BOOL (Asynchronous set input)
SU, SD: BOOL (inputs for up and down)
RST: BOOL (asynchronous reset input)
Setup SS: REAL (step size for small step)
SS: REAL (step size for small step)
Limit_H: REAL (upper limit)
RST_VAL: REAL (initial value after reset)
RST_VAL: REAL (initial value after reset)
T1: TIME (time after the frst ramp starts)
T1: TIME (time in which the second ramp starts)
S1: REAL (speed for frst ramp)
S2: REAL (speed for second ramp)
Output Y: REAL (output signal)
TUNE sets, using up and down buttons, an output signal Y. By correspon￾ding setup variables, the increment will be programmed individually. An
upper and lower limit for the output Y can be specifed by LIMIT_L and LI￾MIT_H . with the buttons SU and SD up or down steps are generated. If a
key is held down longer than the time T1, then the output Y is continuously
adjusted up or down. The speed, which with the output is adjusted here, is
given by S1. S1 and S2 indicate the units per second. Is a button held
down longer than the time T2, the device automatically switches to a se￾cond speed S2. With the inputs RST and SET the output can at any time be
adjusted by RST_VAL resp. SET_VAL to a predetermined value.
