TUNE sets, using up and down buttons, an output signal Y. By correspon￾ding setup variables, the increment will be programmed individually. An
upper and lower limit for the output Y can be specifed by LIMIT_L and LI￾MIT_H . with the buttons SU and SD up or down steps are generated. If a
key is held down longer than the time T1, then the output Y is continuously
adjusted up or down. The speed, which with the output is adjusted here, is
given by S1. S1 and S2 indicate the units per second. Is a button held
down longer than the time T2, the device automatically switches to a se￾cond speed S2. With the inputs RST and SET the output can at any time be
adjusted by RST_VAL resp. SET_VAL to a predetermined value.
