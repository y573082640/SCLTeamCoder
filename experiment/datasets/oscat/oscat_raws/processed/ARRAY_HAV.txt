ARRAY_HAV calculates the harmonic median value of an ar￾bitrary array of REAL. When called, a pointer to the array and its size in
bytes is passed to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads:
ARRAY_HAV(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of the
array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which identifes the
pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines
the size of the array. In order to determine the maximum, the array refe￾renced by the pointer is scanned directly in memory. The function
ARRAY_HAV does not change the content of the array. 
This type of processing arrays is very efcient because no additional me￾mory is required and no surrender values must be copied.
