M_TX determined from the input signal IN the time which the signal IN was
TRUE (TH) and the time the signal was set to FALSE (TL). The times of TH
and TL are only measured after a rising or falling edge. If IN is at the frst
call of the module already high, this is not seen as a rising edge. From the
measured values of TH and TL the Duty Cycle and the frequency in Hz are
calculated. A Duty Cycle of 0.4 means the signal was 40% TRUE and 60%
FALSE. Output ET of type TIME is started with each rising edge at 0 and
runs up until the next rising edge it starts again at 0. With a TRUE at the
input RST, the outputs can be reset at any time to 0. The input TMAX sets,
after which the elapsed time at ET, the outputs automatically are reseted.
TMAX is internally assigned a default value of T#10d and can normally be
left open. The input TMAX is primarily used to reset in the absence of input
signal for a defned time the outputs. An example of a possible application
is to measure the speed of a wave, indicating absence of the sensor si￾gnals to the speed (frequency) 0. TMAX is used with caution because, for
example, a TMAX of 10 seconds at the same time limits the smallest mea￾surable frequency to 0.1 Hz.
