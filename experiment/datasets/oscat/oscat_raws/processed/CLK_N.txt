CLK_N generates a pulse every X milliseconds, based on the PLC internal 1
ms reference. The pulses are exactly one PLC cycle length and are generaï¿¾ted every 2^N milliseconds.
The period is 1 ms for N = 0, 2ms for N = 1, 4ms, for N=2
CLK_N replaces the modules CLK_1ms, CLK_2ms, CLK_4ms and CLK_8ms
from older libraries.
The following picture shows the output signal for N=0:
