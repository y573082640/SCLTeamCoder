Input DIR: BOOL ( Direction, TRUE means Up ) 
E: BOOL ( Enable Input) 
TR: TIME (time to run a full ramp)
I / O RMP: BYTE (output signal)
_RMP_B Is an 8-bit ramp generator. The ramp is generated in an externally
declared variable. The ramp is rising when DIR = TRUE and falling if DIR =
FALSE. Reaching a fnal value of the ramp, the generator remains at this
value. With the input E the ramp can be stopped at any time, when E =
TRUE the ramp runs. The input TR shows the time which is needed to cy￾cle through 0-255 or the other way around.
