RES_PT calculates the resistance of a PT resistance sensor from the input
values T (temperature in °C) and R0 (resistance at 0°C).
The calculation is done using the formula:
for temperatures > 0 °C
RES_PT = R0 * (1 + A*T + B*T²)
and for temperatures below 0 ° C
RES_PT = R0 * (1 + A*T + B*T² + C*(T-100)*T³
A = 3.90802E-3
B = -5.80195E-7
C = -427350E-12
The calculation is suitable for temperatures from -200.. +850°C.
