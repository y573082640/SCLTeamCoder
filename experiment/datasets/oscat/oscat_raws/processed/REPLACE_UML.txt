REPLACE_UML replaces umlauts with a combination of two characters so
that the result contains no more umlauts. The large and small letters are
considered here. If a word is all upper case and is an umlaut is mentioned,
this is replaced by a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter, in the
case of a ß which has no capitals there will always be replaced with two
small letters. If the function REPLACE_UML is used on a uppercase word,
then it must be ensured using the function UPPERCASE() that all capital
letters that the lower case are again converted to uppercase.
Ä > Ae, Ö > Oe, Ü > Ue, ä > ae, ö > oe, ü > oe, ß > ss.
