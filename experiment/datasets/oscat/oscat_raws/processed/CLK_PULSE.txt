Type Function module
Input PT: TIME (cycle time)
N: INT (number of pulses to be generated)
RST: BOOL (Reset)
Output Q: BOOL (clock output)
CNT: INT (counter of output pulses)
RUN: BOOL (TRUE, if pulse generator is running)
CLK_PULSE generates a defned number of clock pulses with a program￾mable duty cycle. PT defnes the duty cycle and N is the number of gene￾rated pulses. WIth a reset input RST, the generator can be restarted at
any time. The output CNT counts the pulses generated and RUN = TRUE
indicates that the generator currently generate pulses. An input value N =
0 generates an infnite pulse series, the maximum number of pulses is li￾mited to 32767.
The following example shows an application of CLK_PULSE for the produc￾tion of 7 pulses with a duty cycle of 100 ms.
The trace recording, shows how the RESET (green) is inactive and thus
RUN (red) is active. The generator generates then 7 pulses (blue), as spe￾cifed at the input N. The output CNT counts from 1 on the frst pulse to 7
by the last pulse. After the end of the sequence RUN is inactive again and
the cycle is complete until it is started by a new reset.
