Type Function: BOOL
Input IDATE: DATE (date)
Output BOOL (TRUE if IDATE is a leap year)
The function LEAP_OF_DATE tests whether the input date is in a leap year.
The function calculates whether a date falls within a leap year and returns
TRUE if necessary. The test is valid for the time window from 1970 to
2099. In the year 2100 a leap year is indicated although this is not one.
However, since the range of dates according to IEC61131-3 extends only
to the year 2106 this correction will be omitted.
Example: LEAP_OF_YEAR(D#2004-01-12) = TRUE
