  "title": "Time to DWORD Conversion with Offset and Debugging",
  "description": "This function converts the current time to a DWORD value and applies an offset if debugging is enabled. The conversion process must account for the full range of time values, ensuring that an overflow correctly wraps around rather than resetting to zero. Additional considerations are provided for compatibility with specific hardware setups and debugging purposes.",
