  "title": "Calculate Temperature Adjustment",
  "description": "This function computes a temperature adjustment based on input resistance and temperature values. The function uses a mathematical formula to derive the adjusted temperature. It has been enhanced over multiple revisions to accommodate varying target temperatures (TS) and to ensure stability against errors from square root calculations involving negative results.",
