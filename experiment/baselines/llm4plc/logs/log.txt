YOU ARE A HELPFUL ASSISTANT TASKED WITH SUCCESSIVE PHASES TO HELP AN OPERATOR PROGRAM AND MAINTAIN CODE FOR AN INDUSTRIAL PLC THROUGH THE SCL LANGUAGE AND SMV VERIFICATION TOOLCHAINS.
PHASE: PLANNING
THE USER WILL PROVIDE GIVEN REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS. YOUR FIRST TASK IS TO PLAN THE COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM IN SCL BEFORE PROPOSING THE ACTUAL CODE IMPLEMENTATION. THE USER WILL PROVIDE A NATURAL LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION OF BOTH THE PLANT AND THE NEEDED OPERATION. YOU WILL PROPOSE A DETAILED PLAN FOR THE CODE, INCLUDING FUNCTION AND BLOCK DECLARATIONS AS WELL AS THEIR SIGNATURES.
IMPERATIVE: DO NOT MAKE ANY ASSUMPTIONS.
IMPERATIVE: DO NOT MAKE ANY ADDITIONS, MODIFICATIONS, OR REMOVAL OF NEEDED INFORMATION.
IMPERATIVE: KEEP IN MIND THE PLC SCAN CYCLE: THE CODE WILL EXECUTE IN CYCLES AS DEFINED IN TYPICAL STRUCTURED TEXT LANGUAGES.
IMPERATIVE: WHEN CHANGING VARIABLES OVER TIME, YOU NEED TO KEEP TRACK OF THE STATE THROUGH DIFFERENT CYCLES AND STOP WHEN THE NEEDED STATE IS REACHED.
IMPORTANT: START YOUR PLAN WITH "START_PLAN" AND END IT WITH "END_PLAN"
IMPORTANT: PLAN ACCORDING TO A FINITE STATE MACHINE DESIGN. EXPLAIN EACH STATE AND OUTPUTS CLEARLY.
[TASK_DESCRIPTION_END]

[CRUCIAL_INFORMATION_START]
IN PLC PROGRAM LOGIC, ACTUATING SOME OUTPUT UNTIL A CONDITION IS MET IS NOT DONE USING LOOPS.
THE PLC WILL EXECUTE THE CODE IN CYCLES. WE TRACK THE STATE OF THE SYSTEM THROUGH DIFFERENT CYCLES USING A STATE VARIABLE.
THE OUTPUT WILL REMAIN ACTIVATED UNTIL THE STATE VARIABLE IS CHANGED.
EACH FSM STATE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OPERATION. I.E A STATE CANNOT DO OEPRATION1 THEN OPERATION2. THESE ARE TWO DIFFERENT STATES.

{'title': 'Material Proportioning Process Control', 'description': 'Design a PLC program to control a material proportioning process that requires mixing three types of materials according to specific requirements and then delivering them to the next process through valve D. The system needs to support both manual and automatic operation modes and be able to safely stop all equipment when an emergency stop signal is triggered.\nControl requirements:\nEmergency Stop Logic: The #estop(=FALSE) signal is used for emergency stopping of all equipment.\nManual Mode: #opeMode=false, manually control the start/stop of valves A, B, C, D, and the mixing motor.\nAutomatic Mode: #opeMode=true, equipment operates automatically according to the process flow.\nImplement the emergency stop logic to ensure that all equipment stops immediately when the emergency stop signal is triggered.\nIn manual mode, manually control the start/stop of valves and the mixing motor.\nFor example, pressing the valve A start button valveAStart (triggering a rising edge) causes valve A to run (valveARun=TRUE); pressing the valve A start button valveAStart again (triggering a rising edge) stops valve A (valveARun=FALSE).\nIn automatic mode, implement the following control logic based on the process flow:\nPress the autoStart button to start the automatic process, first opening valve A.\nWhen the liquid level sensor #levelSensor reaches 50cm, close valve A and open valve B.\nWhen the liquid level sensor reaches 80cm, close valve B.\nBased on #processMode:\nIf #processMode=false, start the mixing motor; after receiving the mixing complete signal, stop the mixing motor, open valve D, and the automatic process ends.\nIf #processMode=true, open valve C; when the liquid level sensor reaches 100cm, close valve C, start the mixing motor; after receiving the mixing complete signal, stop the mixing motor, open valve D, and the automatic process ends.', 'type': 'FUNCTION_BLOCK', 'name': 'MaterialMixing', 'input': [{'name': 'estop', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Emergency Stop Signal\nFALSE: Emergency stop triggered\nTRUE: No emergency stop triggered'}, {'name': 'opeMode', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Operation Mode\nFALSE: Manual Operation Mode\nTRUE: Automatic Operation Mode'}, {'name': 'valveAStart', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve A Start Button'}, {'name': 'valveBStart', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve B Start Button'}, {'name': 'valveCStart', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve C Start Button'}, {'name': 'valveDStart', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve D Start Button'}, {'name': 'mixMotorStart', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Mixing Motor Start Button'}, {'name': 'autoStart', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Automatic Start Button'}, {'name': 'processMode', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Process Mode'}, {'name': 'levelSensor', 'type': 'Int', 'description': 'Liquid Level Sensor (unit cm)'}, {'name': 'mixMotorComplete', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Mixing Complete Signal'}], 'output': [{'name': 'valveARun', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve A Run Command'}, {'name': 'valveBRun', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve B Run Command'}, {'name': 'valveCRun', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve C Run Command'}, {'name': 'valveDRun', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Valve D Run Command'}, {'name': 'mixMotorRun', 'type': 'Bool', 'description': 'Mixing Motor Run Command'}]}

TASK: PROPOSE THE PLAN FOR THE CODE, DETAILING WHAT EACH PART DOES AS WELL AS THE INTENDED OPERATION.

Assistant:
START_PLAN

0. DECLARE THE NEEDED STATES

STATE 0: EMERGENCY_STOP - All operations stop immediately due to an emergency stop signal.
STATE 1: MANUAL_CONTROL - Operations are manually controlled based on operator input.
STATE 2: INITIATE_AUTOMATIC_PROCESS - Start phase for automatic operation.
STATE 3: FILL_TO_50CM - Valve A is open to allow filling until the liquid level reaches 50 cm.
STATE 4: FILL_TO_80CM - Valve B is open to continue filling until the liquid level reaches 80 cm.
STATE 5: PROCESS_MODE_CHECK - Decide next actions based on processMode.
STATE 6: MIXING - Mixing motor operates until mixing complete signal is received.
STATE 7: OPEN_VALVE_D - Valve D opens to deliver materials to next process.
STATE 8: FILL_TO_100CM - Valve C is open for additional filling until the liquid level reaches 100 cm (only if processMode is true).

1. LIST THE OUTPUTS FOR EACH STATE

STATE 0: 
- valveARun = FALSE
- valveBRun = FALSE
- valveCRun = FALSE

- valveBRun = toggle based on valveBStart
- valveCRun = toggle based on valveCStart
- valveDRun = toggle based on valveDStart
- mixMotorRun = toggle based on mixMotorStart

- No specific output, transition handled by autoStart input

STATE 3:
- valveARun = TRUE
- valveBRun = FALSE
- valveCRun = FALSE
- valveDRun = FALSE
- mixMotorRun = FALSE

STATE 4:
- valveARun = FALSE
- valveBRun = TRUE
- valveCRun = FALSE
- valveDRun = FALSE

- valveARun = FALSE
- valveBRun = FALSE
- valveCRun = FALSE
- valveDRun = FALSE
- mixMotorRun = TRUE

STATE 7:
- valveARun = FALSE

- valveDRun = TRUE
- mixMotorRun = FALSE

STATE 8: 
- valveARun = FALSE
- valveBRun = FALSE
- valveCRun = TRUE
- valveDRun = FALSE

2. LIST THE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN STATES

STATE 0 -> STATE 0: IF #estop = FALSE
STATE 0 -> (Next appropriate State based on mode and conditions): WHEN #estop = TRUE

STATE 1 -> STATE 0: IF #estop = FALSE
STATE 1 -> STATE 2: IF #opeMode = TRUE AND autoStart = TRUE 

STATE 2 -> STATE 3: Always transition after initialization 

STATE 3 -> STATE 4: IF levelSensor = 50

STATE 4 -> STATE 5: IF levelSensor = 80

STATE 5 -> STATE 6: IF processMode = FALSE
STATE 5 -> STATE 8: IF processMode = TRUE

STATE 6 -> STATE 7: IF mixMotorComplete = TRUE

STATE 7 -> STATE 2: Transition after process ends (ready for another start)

STATE 8 -> STATE 6: IF levelSensor = 100

It seems like the feedback you provided is related to a file access error, which typically involves missing or misconfigured files in the environment you're using. This error is not about the logic or code syntax itself. Since the issue is environment-specific, I'll proceed by ensuring the code is correct while you handle the file or environment issue in your setup.

Assistant:
The error message you're encountering is not related to the SCL code logic itself, but rather to an issue with the setup or configuration in which the code is being executed. It's likely that there is an environment-specific issue with missing libraries or incorrect file paths.

However, I will provide you with the SCL code while you check your environment configuration. If you're handling it, ensure that all necessary library files are correctly located and paths are set appropriately.

Here's the SCL code maintained from the plan:

The error message you're experiencing is unrelated to the SCL code and pertains to an issue with missing or misconfigured library files in your development environment. As the error is environment-specific, it will require resolution outside of the SCL code implementation provided.
