  "title": "Product Production Line Control",
  "description": "The production line consists of three processing stations: Processing Station A, Processing Station B, and Processing Station C. The product needs to pass through A, B, and C sequentially for processing. The production line has a motor responsible for moving the product from one processing station to the next. Each processing station has a sensor (to detect if the product has arrived) and a processing completion indicator light. Control requirements: - The product arrives at Processing Station A, Sensor_A detects the product, and after the processing completion indicator light Finished_Light_A lights up, the motor starts forward rotation to move the product to Processing Station B. - The product arrives at Processing Station B, Sensor_B detects the product, the motor stops, and after the processing completion indicator light Finished_Light_B lights up, the motor starts forward rotation to move the product to Processing Station C. - The product arrives at Processing Station C, Sensor_C detects the product, the motor stops, and after the processing completion indicator light Finished_Light_C lights up, the pickup indicator light (SortCompletionLight) lights up. When the product is picked up, meaning Sensor_C no longer detects the product, the pickup indicator light (CompletionLight) turns off. Additionally, it allows operators to manually switch the exhaust fan (Exhaust_Fan_Button) and intake fan (Intake_Fan_Button) via buttons, which are interlocked and cannot be turned on simultaneously. A program is required to control the motor, exhaust fan, intake fan, and pickup indicator light.",
