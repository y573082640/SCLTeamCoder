{ "title": "Automated Assembly Line Control", "description": "An automated assembly line is responsible for inspecting, assembling, testing, and packaging products. Each step of the production line is controlled by a PLC and triggered by sensor and operator input signals.\nControl requirements:\nWhen the productSensor detects a product, it triggers the inspection device to start and continue working.\nAfter inspection is complete, the operator uses the inspectionConfirmButton to trigger the inspection completion signal, automatically starting the assembly device for assembly.\nAfter assembly is complete, the operator uses the assemblyConfirmButton to trigger the assembly completion signal, automatically starting the testing device for testing.\nAfter testing is complete, the operator uses the testingConfirmButton to trigger the testing completion signal, starting the packaging device for packaging.\nAfter packaging is complete, the operator uses the packingConfirmButton to trigger the packaging completion signal, lighting the packaging completion indicator light.\nAfter the operator removes the packaged product, they press the resetButton to reset the indicator light and prepare for the next product production cycle.", "type": "FUNCTION_BLOCK", "name": "LGF_ProductAssembly", "input": [ { "name": "productSensor", "type": "Bool", "description": "Product arrival sensor, triggers signal when a product is detected" }, { "name": "inspectionConfirmButton", "type": "Bool", "description": "Operator confirmation button, used to confirm inspection process completion" }, { "name": "assemblyConfirmButton", "type": "Bool", "description": "Operator confirmation button, used to confirm assembly process completion" }, { "name": "testingConfirmButton", "type": "Bool", "description": "Operator confirmation button, used to confirm testing process completion" }, { "name": "packingConfirmButton", "type": "Bool", "description": "Operator confirmation button, used to confirm packaging process completion" }, { "name": "resetButton", "type": "Bool", "description": "Operator confirmation button, used to confirm product removal" } ], "output": [ { "name": "Inspection_Device", "type": "Bool", "description": "Control output for inspection device operation" }, { "name": "Assembly_Device", "type": "Bool", "description": "Control output for assembly device operation" }, { "name": "Testing_Device", "type": "Bool", "description": "Control output for testing device operation" }, { "name": "Packing_Device", "type": "Bool", "description": "Control output for packaging device operation" }, { "name": "Packed_Light", "type": "Bool", "description": "Packaging completion indicator light" } ] }
