{ "title": "Automated Production Line Workstation Management System", "description": "In an automated production line, a system is needed to manage the occupancy status of each workstation to ensure each workstation can be used and released efficiently. The production line has 10 workstations, each numbered from 1 to 10, and each workstation can only handle one workpiece at a time.\nControl requirements:\n1. The system needs to maintain the occupancy status of the workstations, recording whether each workstation is currently processing a workpiece.\n2. When a new workpiece needs processing:\n    - Check the occupancy status of the workstations.\n    - If there are available workstations, prioritize the workstation with the highest number for processing.\n    - If all workstations are occupied, output error status error=1 and error code status=16#8001.\n3. When a workpiece is processed:\n    - Check the occupancy status of the workstations.\n    - If there are workstations processing workpieces, prioritize releasing the workstation with the lowest number.\n    - If all workstations are idle, output error status error=1 and error code status=16#8002.\n4. The system should be able to output the current number of workpieces being processed and the number of available workstations.", "type": "FUNCTION_BLOCK", "name": "LGF_WorkstationManagement", "input": [ { "name": "requestProcess", "type": "Bool", "description": "New workpiece processing request signal" }, { "name": "requestComplete", "type": "Bool", "description": "Workpiece processing completion request signal" } ], "output": [ { "name": "processingNum", "type": "Int", "description": "Current number of workpieces being processed" }, { "name": "freeStationNum", "type": "Int", "description": "Number of available workstations" }, { "name": "error", "type": "Bool", "description": "FALSE: No error occurred\nTRUE: Error occurred" }, { "name": "status", "type": "Word", "description": "Status code" } ], "in/out": [ { "name": "workstation", "type": "Array[1..10] of Bool", "description": "Occupancy status of workstations, 1 indicates occupied, 0 indicates available" } ], "status_code": [ { "16#8001": "STATUS_ALL_OCCUPIED", "16#8002": "STATUS_ALL_EMPTY" } ] }
