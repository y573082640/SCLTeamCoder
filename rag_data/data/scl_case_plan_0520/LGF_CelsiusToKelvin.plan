In the conversion region, the temporary variable tempKelvinTemperature is assigned the sum of the input value (value in \u00b0Celsius) and the constant TEMPERATURE_OFFSET.\n# Step4. In the outputs region, the result stored in the temporary variable tempKelvinTemperature is assigned to the function return variable LGF_CelsiusToKelvin, which represents the temperature in \u00b0Kelvin.\n# Step5.
