Declare the input variable 'variableBinary' of type DWord to hold the binary coded value to be converted to Gray code.\n# Step2. Declare a constant BIT_SHIFT_1 and initialize it with 1, which will be used as the parameter for the bit shift operation.\n# Step3. In the OUTPUTS region, use the XOR operation between 'variableBinary' and the result of the SHR operation that shifts 'variableBinary' by BIT_SHIFT_1 bits to the right to get the Gray code.\n# Step4. The result of the XOR operation is assigned to the function's return value LGF_BinaryToGray.\n# Step5. Since no error handling is needed, set the ENO variable to TRUE.", "name": "LGF_BinaryToGray"}
