Define the input parameters 'value' and 'bitNo' for the function, which represent the DWORD variable and the bit position to be toggled, respectively.\n# Step2. Define the constants 'TRUE_BOOL_BIT' as a DWORD with only the least significant bit set and 'MAX_NO_OF_BITS' as the total number of bits in a DWORD.\n# Step3. Use the 'SHL' instruction to shift the 'TRUE_BOOL_BIT' left by 'bitNo' modulo 'MAX_NO_OF_BITS' positions to create a mask with a single TRUE bit at the desired position.\n# Step4. Use the 'XOR' instruction to toggle the bit at the 'bitNo'-th position in 'value' by performing an exclusive OR operation with the mask generated in the previous step.\n# Step5. Return the result of the XOR operation as the output of the function, which is the input 'value' with the specified bit toggled.\n# Step6.
