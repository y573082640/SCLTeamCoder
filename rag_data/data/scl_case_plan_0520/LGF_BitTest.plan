Define constants BINARY_ZERO, TRUE_BOOL_BIT, and MAX_NO_OF_BITS for use in the bit test operation.\n# Step2. Implement the bit test logic by shifting a true bit into the selected position using the SHL instruction and the MOD instruction to ensure the bit number is within the valid range.\n# Step3. Use the AND logic operation to compare the shifted true bit with the input value.\n# Step4. If the result of the AND operation is not equal to BINARY_ZERO, the bit at the given position is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE. Assign this result to the function return value #LGF_BitTest.\n# Step5.
