Define the input variable value for receiving the temperature in \u00b0Kelvin.\nStep2. Define a temporary variable tempRankineTemperature for calculating the intermediate Rankine temperature.\nStep3. Define a constant TEMPERATURE_GAIN with the value 1.8, which is the factor to convert Kelvin to Rankine.\nStep4. Multiply the input value by the TEMPERATURE_GAIN to calculate the Rankine temperature and store it in tempRankineTemperature.\nStep5. Assign the calculated Rankine temperature from tempRankineTemperature to the function's return value.\nStep6.
