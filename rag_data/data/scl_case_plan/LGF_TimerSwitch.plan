Store the current time in tempActTimeDtl and convert it to a time of day format using the DTL_TO_TOD instruction.\nStep5. Depending on the mode specified by the input parameter mode, perform the following actions:\n- For MODE_DAILY, adjust the on and off times to be within the same day.\n- For MODE_WEEKLY, adjust the on and off times to be within the same week.\n- For MODE_MONTHLY, adjust the on and off times to be within the same month.\n- For MODE_YEARLY, adjust the on and off times to be within the same year.\n- For MODE_WEEK_DAYS, adjust the on and off times to be within the working days (Monday to Friday).\n- For MODE_WEEKEND_DAYS, adjust the on and off times to be within the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).\n- For MODE_PERMANENTLY_ON, set the signal to true.\n- For MODE_PERMANENTLY_OFF, set the signal to false.\nStep6.
