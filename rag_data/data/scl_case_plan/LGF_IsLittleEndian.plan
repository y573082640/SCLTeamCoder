Shift the BIT_PATTERN_ONE left by the value of MOVE_BIT_POS using the SHL instruction and store the result in tempSixteenBits.\nStep3. Check the least significant bit of tempSixteenBits to determine endianness. If the least significant bit is 0 (tempSixteenBits.%B0 = B#16#00), the system is little-endian, and set the function return value LGF_IsLittleEndian to TRUE.\nStep4.
