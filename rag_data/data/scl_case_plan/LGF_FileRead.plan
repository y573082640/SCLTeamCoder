Initialize the internal state of the function block, including setting the main state to no processing and initializing diagnostics.\nStep 2. Check for the rising edge of the execute input and initialize the function block if it's the first call.\nStep 3. Enter a state machine loop that processes different states based on the main state variable.\nStep 4. In the initialization state, verify the file path, buffer boundaries, and parameter data types.\nStep 5. If the file path is incorrect, buffer boundaries are invalid, or data serialization fails, set the error status and exit.\nStep 6. If the file path is correct and the buffer is valid, proceed to the file reading state.\nStep 7. In the file reading state, use the FileReadC instruction to read the file into the buffer.\nStep 8. If the file read operation encounters an error or the file size does not match the expected size, set the appropriate error status and exit.\nStep 9. If the file read operation is successful, proceed to the parameter handling state.\nStep 10. In the parameter handling state, either copy the data from the buffer to the output parameter if it's a byte array, or deserialize the data from the buffer if it's not a byte array.\nStep 11. If data handling fails, set the error status and exit.\nStep 12. If data handling is successful, update the diagnostics to indicate that execution has finished.\nStep 13. Update the output parameters based on the function block's state and diagnostics.\nStep 14. If the function block is in an undefined state, set the error status and exit.\nStep 15.
