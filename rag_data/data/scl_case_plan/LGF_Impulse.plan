Initialize the temporary variables tempImpulse and tempCountdown to undefined as they do not have explicit initial values.\nStep 2. Check if the input frequency is less than or equal to zero. If true, set tempImpulse to FALSE and tempCountdown to zero time.\nStep 3. If the frequency has changed since the last cycle, recalculate the pulse period by dividing THOUSAND_SECONDS by the truncated frequency multiplied by THOUSAND.\nStep 4. Use the NOT operator and the Q output of the TOF_TIME instruction to determine the current impulse state and assign it to tempImpulse.\nStep 5. Configure the TOF_TIME instruction with the inverted impulse state as the input (IN) and the calculated period as the preset time (PT).\nStep 6. Calculate the remaining time until the next pulse by subtracting the elapsed time (ET) of the TOF_TIME instruction from the pulse period, and assign this value to tempCountdown.\nStep 7. Assign the values of tempImpulse and tempCountdown to the output variables impulse and countdown, respectively.\nStep 8.
