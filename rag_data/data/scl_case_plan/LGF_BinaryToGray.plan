Define the input variable variableBinary of type DWord to hold the binary coded value.\nStep2. Define a constant BIT_SHIFT_1 with a value of 1, which will be used as the bit shift amount.\nStep3. Perform an XOR operation between the input variableBinary and the result of a SHR (shift right) operation on variableBinary by BIT_SHIFT_1 to convert the binary value to a Gray-coded value.\nStep4. Assign the result of the XOR and SHR operations to the function's return value, effectively setting the Gray-coded value.\nStep5.
