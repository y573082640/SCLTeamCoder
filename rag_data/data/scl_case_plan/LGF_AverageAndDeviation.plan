Compute the arithmetic average by iterating over the array elements, summing them with a FOR loop, and dividing by the number of elements converted to LReal with DINT_TO_REAL.\nStep4. Calculate the standard deviation by iterating over the array elements again, summing the squared differences from the arithmetic average, and dividing by the number of elements, then taking the square root of the result.\nStep5.
