Check if the input Unix time is less than the number of seconds from 1970 to 1990.

Check if the input Unix time is exactly equal to the number of seconds from 1970 to 1990. If true, set the output DTL to the lower limit, set error to FALSE, set status to WARN_CONVERSION_LIMIT, and return.\nStep3. Calculate the date part of the DTL by subtracting the DELTA_1970_1990 from the input Unix time, dividing by the number of seconds per day, and converting to a DATE data type.\nStep4. Calculate the time part of the DTL by subtracting the date part in seconds from the total Unix time, then get the hour, minute, and second components by using division and modulo operations with the number of seconds per hour and minute.\nStep5. Assign the calculated date and time to the temporary DTL variable.\nStep6. Set the output DTL to the calculated DTL value, set error to FALSE, set status to STATUS_NO_ERRROR, and force ENO to TRUE as the ENO mechanism is not used.", "name": "LGF_UnixTimeToDTL"}
