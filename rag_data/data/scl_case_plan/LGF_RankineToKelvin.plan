The function begins by declaring the input variable 'value' which holds the temperature in \u00b0Rankine to be converted.\nStep2. A temporary variable 'tempKelvinTemperature' is declared to hold the converted temperature value in \u00b0Kelvin.\nStep3. Two constant variables 'TEMPERATURE_GAIN_NUMERATOR' and 'TEMPERATURE_GAIN_DENOMINATOR' are declared with the values for the conversion fraction.\nStep4. The conversion from \u00b0Rankine to \u00b0Kelvin is performed by calculating the expression '(TEMPERATURE_GAIN_NUMERATOR / TEMPERATURE_GAIN_DENOMINATOR) * value' and storing the result in 'tempKelvinTemperature'.\nStep5. The final converted temperature is assigned to the function's return value.\nStep6.
