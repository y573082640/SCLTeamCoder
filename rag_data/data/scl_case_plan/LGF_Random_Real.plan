Initialize the output variables error, status, and subfunctionStatus to their default values.\nStep2. Read the system time and store it in the tempTime variable. Convert the status of the read operation to a Word and store it in tempTimeStatus.\nStep3. Check if the system time was read successfully by comparing tempTimeStatus with the constant SUB_STATUS_NO_ERROR.\nStep4. If there is an error in reading the system time, set the error flag to true, update the status and subfunctionStatus with error codes, set the function return value to zero, and exit the function.\nStep5. If the system time was read successfully, convert the nanosecond part of the system time to a DWord and manipulate its bytes to create a random start value in tempRandomValue.\nStep6. Normalize the random start value to a real number between 0.0 and 1.0 by dividing it by MAX_UDINT and assign it to the function's return value LGF_Random_Real.\nStep7.
